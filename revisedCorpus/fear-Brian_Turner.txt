FEAR

     I can tell you what fear is 
and when it started. 
     It's a policeman's little black book 
and what goes down in it.

     Your father told you about it 
and the consequences 
      of misdemeanour, that crimp, 
which became the book

     that grows under your skin, 
watermarks of conscience throughout, 
     contrition sharp as barley grass 
in your socks, and like confessions

     hard to extract. 'Experience 
is the best teacher,' Dad said, 
      'and we're part of yours,' 
Mum added, her eyes the colour of peat,

     except when joy dismissed 
anguish whereupon they turned 
      biscuit-brown, then lightened, 
shone like acorns. You don't find

     peace there – at least I didn't, 
and haven't – when you're downcast 
      like a colt without shoes 
standing in the fitful shade.
