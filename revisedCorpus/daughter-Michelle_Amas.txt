Daughter


The Steeple Chase

Get off my back 
daughter 
this is not dancing
you have sharpened your spurs.

Get off my back
you are giving me 
the fingers 
behind my head.

Get off my back 
you have me pinned 
against the ropes 
the ref is on his tea break.

Get off my back 
I am not carrying you 
to my grave.

Get off my back 
from up there you are 
taller than me.

I will not race you 
to the finish line 
race you to freedom 
I will not count down.

I am not your competitor 
daughter 
you signed me up
without my permission.

I am not your 
leap frog.


Golden Delicious

She is sunny 
she is sunny side up, my girl 
running to meet me. 
The other girls look lumpy 
with their slumping shoulders 
dyed hair and regrowth. 
But my one is a beautiful apple 
rolling down the drive 
out past the school gates.


Blame

It is my fault 
her toenails 
her thighs 
the hideous 
hair on her arms.

My fault 
she has too many books 
it’s making her schoolbag 
fat.

Fat is my fault 
I don’t feed her 
correctly, don’t limit 
her intake.

My fault 
the failed marriage 
I am simply 
unlovable.

No money is my fault 
what sort of grown-up 
is an actress.

No brothers or sisters 
my biggest fault 
an unpardonable crime.


Babies

It’s a feast or a famine 
with sperm 
wouldn’t you say? 
Some days they can lap at your feet 
other days are shorter.

I see flakes of babies 
on hands 
on shirt fronts 
on benches 
on car back-seats

The old guy, toothless and cursing
wearing socks and jandals 
is full of babies.

The college boy 
has left babies 
on his sheets this morning.


The Unborn Ones

The brothers and sisters 
how stupid of them 
to leave it up to me.

Stupid too 
the German psychologist’s 
advice.

One child will now 
bury her parents.

The brothers and sisters 
salty baby mammals 
have returned to the sea

turning into little grey whales.


Alliteration

Bullshit, she says 
and I better bloody not be. 
I watch her b’s bounce off 
the breakfast table, 
stinging little orange and black 
bumbles 
stick to my hair.


The txt

Mum come upstairz 
my throats 2 sore 
2 call out 2 u.

In firemother red 
I take the stairs 
two at a time.
