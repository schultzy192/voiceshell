MUTE SONG

i


The first time I saw you 
I don’t know which I loved more 
you with your tranquil neck 
calmly transporting yourself through the world 
or the one who followed you everywhere 
trolling the dark waters like a hook.


ii


The strange thing was that 
as each other’s opposite and negative 
we were even visible 
I with my tatty winter coat 
smelling of reeds 
you consisting entirely of surfaces 
or should I say one fabulously curved surface 
smooth and white as an egg.


iii


I have no idea what you saw when you looked at me 
a shadow dully pursued by the shape that cast it 
a placeholder reserving a space from nonexistence. 
Perhaps you saw God’s fearsome ability 
to be absent, his morosely taken option 
to hoard his riches in another universe. 
In anyone else, such a thought would be absurd. 
In your case, it was luminous and adorable 
shining in the dark location known as me.


iv


It was inevitable I would follow you 
the sound of laughing that came 
though you never laughed 
the sweet nonsensical conversations 
in which you remained impassively silent 
the pointless journeys you took 
your eyes perfectly round. 
My desire was the desire to be superlative 
I, who had spent years in domestic craft 
became selfishly single-minded as an artist 
inflicting your beauty on myself 
like some ecstatic adolescent 
cutting her arm with a pocket knife.


v


At night I would disappear. 
You and the moon would glow. 
I hated to think of the dark 
covering you over like a mouth.
