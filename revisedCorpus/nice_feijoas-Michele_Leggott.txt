NICE FEIJOAS

sometimes you meet the title 
walking home and the first lines 
present themselves at the corner 
as you turn and the low slant of the sun 
means they haven't turned off 
daylight saving this year though 
the computers switched yesterday 
and we fell back not even noticing 
the difference   dark mornings 
for long evenings      a good trade 
but the sign at the neighbour's gate 
goes out on tree time and that's 
the tuning to set feet walking 
over the easily deceived surface 
of the waking mind      gold coins 
for bags of fruit by the blackboard 
under the jacaranda      the clock 
at the gate the clock on the screen 
and somewhere between them 
whatever it is to be done as the day 
shakes a leg and the heart puts up

its fun      September's Baccalaureate 
a perfect mirror from somewhere else 
crickets crows and retrospects      that view 
we swim towards in the flat blue water 
full of mangrove seeds and the bities 
that get between lycra and skin 
when the sea is warm and the moon 
flies up each night towards Easter

they thought the dog might not 
pull through a night to forget 
I carried her in my arms when she 
could not walk and someone 
on the other side of the park 
gave us a ride to the clinic      a drip 
and many gold coins later 
she is ok and the cnidaria stings 
have worked their poison out 
of our unlovely hides      everyone 
sleeps better and is looking forward 
to hot cross buns      the togs drip dry 
washed out with soap to eliminate 
the locomotion of jellyfish 
and the poet philosophers turn back 
to their elegant connection 
of continents and light
