The Child in the Gardens: Winter

How sudden, this entering the fallen 
gardens for the first time, to feel the blisters 
of the world’s father, as his own hand 
does. It is everything dying at once, 
the slimed pond and the riffling of leaves, 
shoes drenched across sapless stalks. 
It is what you will read a thousand times. 
You will come to think, who has not stood 
there, holding that large hand, not said 
Can’t we go back – I don’t like this place. 
Your voice sounds like someone else’s. You 
rub a sleeve against your cheek, you want 
him to laugh, to say, ‘The early stars can’t hurt 
us, they are further than trains we hear 
on the clearest of nights.’ We are in a story
called Father, We Must Get Out. 
Leaves scritch at the red walls, 
a stone lady lies near the pond, eating
dirty grass. It is too sudden, this 
walking into time for its first lesson, 
its brown wind, its scummed nasty 
paths. You know how lovely yellow 
is your favourite colour, the kitchen at home.
You touch the big gates as you leave, 
the trees stand on their bones, the shoulders 
on the vandaled statue are huge cold 
eggs. Nothing there wants to move. 
You touch the gates and tell them, We 
are not coming back to this place. Are we, Dad?
