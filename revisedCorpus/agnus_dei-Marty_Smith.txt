AGNUS DEI

I carried the lamb in a sack on my horse 
the tongue hanging grey and limp. 
It’s buggered, said Dad, throw it in the creek. 
The creek leaped, dimpled. Small bubbles 
whirled, it rumpled where I was looking 
the water shadowed half-blue-black

deep just there with duckweed floating out 
the yards behind all noise, the cattle swirling 
up air swelled with dust and bellowing. 
Flies lighted on and off the rails. 
I took the lamb and kneeled in the pudgy mud 
both hands under it, under the water,

laid it carefully into the shocked cold. 
It hardly struggled, there was so little left. 
Put the bloody thing out of its misery 
I heard in my head as I pushed it under 
and the water shuddered. 
Get the hell out of that he yelled at my back

you macabre little bastard! 
It might have been ghoulish, he was good with words. 
The yards were sweating hot 
Dad wiped his hatband, the sack smelling 
of dry stiff flax, I wiped my nose 
my hand all mud and numb.

The birds hummed. In rain, in wind 
I go out all hours on my lambing beat 
he’s the shadow of me, always riding beside me. 
Let it go he said, quietly. I let it go floating 
it bobbed and the sun caught the eye, closing. 
Shush, shush, said the creek.
