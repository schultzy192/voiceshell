BEFORE WE ALL HUNG OUT IN CAFÃ‰S

At primary school on the monkey bars 
we'd hang, aching, from the middle rung

having riffed our way along the first six bars 
then the wrench in the shoulders at the seventh.

Nowhere to go but the classroom or home 
from the patch of rubbed out grass

where the rhythm failed us.
