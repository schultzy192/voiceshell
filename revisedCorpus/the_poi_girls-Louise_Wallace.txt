THE POI GIRLS

Kahu, Mere, and Faith 
stand on the grass 
by the corner. 
They lean 
on the fence and watch you 
walk past – 
spinning, twirling their poi. 
Pou 
Pou 
Pou 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi, 
with each hard slap 
of their poi. 

On your way home 
they're in the same spot, 
Kahu, Mere, and Faith. 
Their older brothers and cousins 
are fixing the car, out 
on Mere's lawn. 
The boys stop as you 
walk by. 
They lean their hands 
on the car's sides and look out 
from under the hood. 
What 
you 
want? 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi. 

You're walking 
down the dip 
but you have left 
your shoes at school. 
The yellow seeds 
stick to your feet, 
and when you get up 
the other side, The Poi Girls 
are looking 
at you. 
Om 
Om 
Om–mee 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi. 
Piss off, 
you tell them, 
leave me alone. 
You don't need 
their crap as well. 

You stuff Pak 'n Save bags 
into white plastic 
and tie 
them up with string. 
You walk past the corner 
twirling and spinning, 
Hey 
you! 
Bumheads! 
you say with your Pak 'n Save poi. 
The Poi Girls chase you 
down the street 
but you are too little and fast 
for them, 
especially for Faith, the fat one, 
the one with the lighter skin. 

One day in the cloakroom 
It's just you and Thomas 
and he tells you 
you have beautiful eyes – 
green and brown, 
just like his girlfriend, Jade's. 
The Poi Girls burst in, twirling. 
You 
kissed 
Thomas! 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi, 
your cheeks 
pounding flush. 

Your sister tells you 
to run through the mud 
and you say you will 
and that you don't even care. 
So you run 
and halfway you sink 
to your waist 
and down the dirt road 
come The Poi Girls, slowing 
to a stop. 
Ha! 
You 
egg 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi 
and leave 
with your sister 
in tow, twirling. 

It's sunny but cold 
that morning, on the way 
to school. 
Mere's front lawn 
is filled with cars, 
and there are people in suits 
and old koros with sticks 
and The Poi Girls stand 
out the front. 
Mere doesn't 
look at you today, 
so Kahu and Faith 
glare twice as hard for her. 
The Poi Girls' poi 
hang still 
from their hands 
and today 
say nothing at all.
