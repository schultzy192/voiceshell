Songs of the fat brown woman
for sista grace (nichols) and the fat black woman


The fat brown woman move in the breeze
under the thatch of the small small fale
braiding sinnet
weaving stories
between the leaves of the pandanus

The fat brown woman sweat in the sun 
lean on a coconut palm 
swaying in the coconut sun 
in colourful lavalava too small for her waist

The fat brown woman in the sea 
is a sight to see 
diving for blue fish red fish 
an occasional eel 
The fat brown woman walking home from the sea 
is a sight to see

Around the fat brown woman there is 
always a man or two 
Big or small 
Smiling smiling 
At the way her hip sway 
At the sound her thigh make 
Around the fat brown woman there is 
always a fly 
or two 
too

See the fat brown woman at a fa’alavelave 
Directing the men the women
A fine mat here
A pig there 
In her fat brown woman voice 
in her fat brown woman style 
gentle but firm 
is the fat brown woman

When the fat brown woman hops on the bus the girls 
and boys whisper 
and men and women whisper 
and children and cat whisper whisper 
and pigs too sometimes 
watch her sway 
sway sway 
and her arms moving like dat 
and a shaking like dat 
is her tummy too

they make room right behind the skinny 
bus driver who gives her a big fat wink 
the fat brown woman takes out a bright red 
hanky wipes the sweat off her brow 
pats her cheek 
adjusts her dress/her bra/
her hip 
chase away the flies 
give the bus driver a mean look 
Is going be a long way to market

So you can look all you want 
And you can watch all you want 
And you can stare all you want 
But the fat brown woman will keep 
swaying her hip 
Keep swaying her hip 
All the way to town



The fat brown woman watches miss universe on tee vee


What do you say is
going through the mind of the fat brown woman
watching miss universe the most beautiful woman in the world?
a aerobic instructa
wants to be a air hostess
a brain surgeon
perhaps
is her dream?
The fat brown woman add more coconut cream to the saka
and adjust her lavalava
call out to her big sista
e! we need to fix dat damn scale!



The fat brown woman’s fat brown sista


Sits in the cool
of an air-conditioned room
directing an organisation
managing an institution
rewriting her constitution



Warning about the fat brown woman


The fat brown woman is quiet as you know
Doesn’t say a word
An occasional laugh
She does not gossip
She does not lie
Will tell you straight away
Whether you sleeping with a fly
but piss the fat brown woman off and you see eyes
you never seen before
and a mouth you
never heard before
And if I was you I’d stay clear out of the way
Of the fat brown woman
When she’s mad
When she’s pissed
I’d stay clear out of the way
If I was you
I’d stay clear out of the way
Of whereva she going sit



A last note on the fat brown woman and shoes


No shoe fits the foot of the fat brown woman
No high heel
No low heel
No prince
No king
Can contain
Constrain
Confine the foot of the fat brown woman
Because the feet of the fat brown woman
Are grounded nicely to the bellies of 
Her Mamas
The fat blue Pacific
The fat brown Earth
Thank you very much
