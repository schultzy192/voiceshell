THE FLYING FOX AND CHE GUEVARA

I cared for my children like a flying fox 
kept them safe under my wings 
when they were small and hesitant

tipped paracetamol and antibiotics 
down persistently inflamed throats 
during endless nights of earache

gassed them with ventolin cocktails 
when asthma stole their breath

had broken bones reset and a tongue bitten off 
from a faulty landing on a trampoline 
reattached in a theatre without movies

then regretted it 
when that fiapoko mouth 
started up again

we've laughed at dinosaurs and cartoons 
at nana crooning Buffalo Soldier 
at pa's jokes and the bills that kept arriving 
for the ever-declining cashflow card

there were the retreads that outlived cars 
and the unexpected appearance of food 
in our sprayed and wiped-out cupboards

there's so much to think about 
as I sit barefoot in church 
behind the vividly turbaned mamas 
paying their respects to Ã‰loi Machoro

a South Pacific Che Guevara 
a dead son of this island

that siege 
and the photo of Machoro 
smashing a ballot box with an axe

immortalised him beyond the bullets 
that felled a man into a crimson pool

my sons are still learning the difference 
between people's needs and wants 
and how to match actions with words

but I remember

they wore their Che Guevara t-shirts 
until they fell off their backs
