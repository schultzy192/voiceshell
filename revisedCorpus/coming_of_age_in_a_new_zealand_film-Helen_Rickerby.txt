COMING OF AGE IN NEW ZEALAND FILM

Setting the scene

The shot pans over a barren 
                                             landscape 
                                             townscape 
                                             waterscape

a dark shape on the horizon 
   enlarges   and becomes 
a girl

Her clothes are daggy 
she is not self-conscious

      Her family 
is small          but close

if she has two parents 
      only 
      one 
really matters 


The wolf

She is minding her own business 
doing whatever 
is it    that girls do 
   even weird girls like her

When the stranger strides in 
confident 
larger   than   life 
                  And there they are now 
                  talking to Mum 
                                             or Dad

She 
hates 
the stranger 
and finds them 
                  strangerly attractive 
      both at once

No wonder she is confused

         She begins to rebel 


There goes innocence

She has reached menarche 
      she reaches down 
   and finds her fingertips 
         are red and sticky

She refuses to accept this

but finds she is uncontrollably drawn to lipstick 
and mirrors 
and possibly boys

         She may see 
         one or other 
         of her parents 
         having sex with the stranger

maybe through a partially opened doorway

She will probably run away

         The woman 
         will scream as she climaxes 


Happy endings

Her family pulls together 
   as they sometimes do 
         in times of 
         adversity

         The stranger is expelled 
                        flung out

            oil and water 
            chalk and cheese

The girl 
      who is almost a woman 
is embraced       like a child

         because by the end of the movie

somebody is dead
