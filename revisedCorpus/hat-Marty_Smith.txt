HAT

Dad wouldn't be seen dead 
without a hat. 
Farm hat, summer hat, town hat 
even when he had hair.

Hat on an angle, hat on horse, 
hat in the truck with dogs.

We fished by stealth 
stalked trout 
with a spear and a light. 
He wore his hat in the dark.

A mile apart by metal road 
my grandmother lived 
on her half of the farm. 
No chance meetings, not even 
a skyline sighting.

She lay in wait in town 
watched 
from the haberdashery 
as he walked up the street. 
She came out as if by accident. 
Hand frail, and clasping 
the front of her coat, 
she gave a coy look 
from the bags of her bloodhound eyesâ€” 
the whole air stopped

he raised his hat, went past.
