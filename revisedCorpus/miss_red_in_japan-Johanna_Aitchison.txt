MISS RED IN JAPAN 

I make telephone calls 
to my bones, eat evenings 
full of 12–year–old 
video credits.

Crows snap black 
on power lines, shine 
beaks inside my leaf window.

My childhood home 
is coffee cans, a frying pan 
on the living room floor.

Mum is a Moritz stick. 
The stove is a piece of dried seaweed.

At night I cover mother 
in a yellow plastic hard hat. 
‘Goodnight dad,’ I call out.

The road is dancing. 
In the dark I salute 
packets of HOPE 
cigarettes inside 
spacelight 
roadside machines.
