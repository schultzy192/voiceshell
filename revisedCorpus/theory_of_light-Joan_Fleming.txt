THEORY OF LIGHT

Andy goes craving all over the beach 
with her red grip and her red grapple.

A red apple after dark isn’t red, 
it’s a black apple.

She says she’ll black up if she doesn’t have salt. 
She finds a sea urchin full of holes.

What’s a blue sea after dark? 
Are these the spaces where breath goes?

I find a gorgeous gold-yellow branch, 
a colour, a describable friend.

We carry our findings, our branches 
and urchins, from end to end.

The blue and red and yellow everywhere 
is our theory of colour, of light.

Young salt-footed fools, you know there are no ends, 
only ends in sight.
