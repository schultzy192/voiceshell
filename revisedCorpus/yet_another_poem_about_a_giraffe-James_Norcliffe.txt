YET ANOTHER POEM ABOUT A GIRAFFE

pity the poor giraffe 
lost on the frozen steppe

his wishbone legs 
make pipe-holes in the snow

the stunted furze 
laughs at his reaching neck

for Africa is 
sixty degrees below

the hoarfrost catches 
in his soulful lashes

his brown eyes lost 
beneath the arctic moon

his blotched hide a map 
of hopeless wishes

the swishing tail 
a pendulum of doom

so he stands withstands 
the bitter polar blast

that rips the fluttering 
pages of his dreams

the flickering pixels 
of a brilliant past

when the world was warm 
and still and green
