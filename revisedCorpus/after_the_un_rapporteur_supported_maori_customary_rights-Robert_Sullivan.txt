AFTER THE UN RAPPORTEUR SUPPORTED MAORI CUSTOMARY RIGHTS 

If it was tattooed in Maori there’d be an indigenous Universe 
in this curvy groove—but it’s a problem of bleeding translation, 
to spit the worldview from a disembodied tongue, no shy body language, 
no pauses and swaying—a tongue like a paintbrush over eyes, face, hupe–nose 
and wide toes, broad brow (is that me you’re picturing, eh?), but 
Maori prose—that first named the land—is almost wahangū, muted. 
The verbs, nouns, adjectives, tenses, all the key teeth thrown 
on the table are English played with by the ancestors of Westminster

and Trickster, scribbled by Councillors and Scrabblers, ammo for Radical 
and Stately mouths, chucked around by cartoons of Ewen Me. English 
has boxed on for 13 centuries since Caedmon like here’s your fish and chips love; 
cuppa tea love; where’s my CliffsNotes on The Odyssey, darling? 
English was broadcast from the moon, is spoken by our family, plus 
it’s orbiting Saturn! Yet Maori liberty is still recognized by Earth.
