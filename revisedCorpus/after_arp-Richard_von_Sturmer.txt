AFTER ARP

Mushrooms 
The flat, black mushrooms 
grow luxurious green hair. 
Green hair edged 
with a band of white. 
Green hair as luminous 
as underwater plants. 
Green hair that can be fashioned 
into horsehair whisks.

The flat, black mushrooms 
exhale clusters of stars. 
They live in a section of the forest 
where no flies can settle.

The Great Slug 
The great slug rides his bicycle. 
His baggy pants can barely contain 
his baggy pants. 
He leaves behind 
a trail of gray foam.

The great slug is a connoisseur 
of sofas and lazy boy recliners. 
He merely rides his bicycle 
to rid himself 
of certain metallic parasites 
which inhabit the deeper recesses 
of his sagging flesh.

If only the great slug 
were a hermaphrodite. 
But his penis 
remains firmly fixed 
in the centre of his forehead.

The slug and I have a long history 
of altercations. 
He’s nothing but an impostor, 
a provocateur, 
a guzzler of kerosene. 
Someday we’ll settle old scores. 
Someday we’ll slug it out.

The Lozenge Box 
fire of flamingos 
smoke of bats 
ash of ants

On one bleak 
mid-winter’s day 
you offered me 
the key to the lozenge box 
and ever since then 
multicoloured pastilles 
continue to tumble out.

a flywheel 
a watering can 
Fidel Castro’s 
fountain pen

Multicoloured pastilles 
continue to tumble out.

*

The Empress of Emptiness 
What a belle, 
what an absolute 
fashion plate.

The Empress of Emptiness 
puts on her tinsel crown 
while the black bluejays 
attack her battlements 
with toothpicks 
and tape recorders.

Serious tinnitus is sweeping through 
Tintagel Castle 
and Titus has gone to ground.

The Empress of Emptiness 
gathers together her long dress 
and disappears 
down the elastic corridor.

*

My Uncle 
My uncle 
the acquirer of spoons 
blind as a bat 
skimming over the Astroturf.

Old polaroids 
lie scattered like tiles 
in his abandoned garden.

For a joke he once placed 
a small, cloth sailor 
inside a condom.

My uncle 
who would break into a sweat 
at the sight of a dead matchstick.

He loved the air 
the letter H 
the sound of castanets.

My uncle 
who hypnotized 
the King of Thailand

When I open the door 
to his garden shed 
sparrows fly out 
from the rusted hinges.

*

Elephants 
Elephants are never 
irrelevant. 
They use adjectives 
to extract 
honey from honeycombs.

*

Dinosaurs 
It’s wrong to compare ourselves with dinosaurs. 
Dinosaurs didn’t use power tools. 
Dinosaurs didn’t do jigsaw puzzles. 
Dinosaurs never put a man on the moon. 
They tore each other to pieces 
and fell into tar pits. 
It’s wrong to compare ourselves with dinosaurs.

*

André Breton’s Inflatable Octopus 
André Breton’s inflatable Octopus 
occupies a portion of Belgium. 
On Google Earth you can see the way 
it sprawls across Brussels 
with one tentacle reaching Antwerp 
and another touching Ghent.

André Breton had a penchant 
for anal eroticism. 
On the other hand 
his inflatable octopus 
is not only immaculate 
but ready, willing and able 
to release a magnificent cloud 
of perfumed ink.

*

Circadian Rhythms 
Tapping on a toadstool 
the sun comes up.

The crickets chirp 
as they go to work 
their little briefcases 
filled with sesame seeds.

Tapping on a capped tooth 
the moon goes down.

Slipped into a black folder 
then filed away 
deep in the archives 
with all the other moons.

*

Our Ancestors 
They found a billiard table 
embedded 
at the centre of an iceberg, 
proof that our Neolithic ancestors 
engaged in recreational activities.

The skeletons of hairy mammoths 
still bear the scars

of their billiard cues.

And look— 
over the horizon 
kicking up the tundra 
a great, enraged herd 
of magnetic wildebeest!

*

Captain Cook’s Hat 
There’s a tree growing 
on Captain Cook’s hat 
two trees in fact, 
one on the top 
and one on the side.

The erratic navigator 
likes to swim 
with his dorsal-finned compass

and the blue almond sky

and the blue almond sky.
