Sacred Pulu


let me rip off 
your images 
and write about the bleeding beetroot pink purity 
of Cook Islands potato salad 
melting into subtropical mango horizons, 
let me crap on poetically papaya 
inhaling the bottle blonde fragrance of gardenia 
let me pop some pods of vanilla 
and talk dried banana bullshit

let me write about 
the mountains of Manu’a 
from the flats of Mangere town centre 
let me shower you 
with falling frangipani fakeness 
$2 a lei from a Chinese shop in Otahu 
let me keep it real 
with the bitterness of lime from Foodtown $15.99 a kg 
for raw fish ota ika perfection

let me bowl you a type of stereo 
that sings lotto-ad-styles 
hula hip hop 
wop de fob 
fresh fresh fresh 
out of the deep freeze

let me scream a Niuean chant 
like Xena 
and slap my chest ma’ulu’ulu style 
till my Wonderbra sings like a coconut 
let me siva you away like Sosefina 
last song, feeling up the dancefloor

let me romanticise us 
away from
the grubby white sneaker existence 
stuck to chewing gum of Otara markets 
carried into the CBD of Saturday night 
the fruit is so bright 
we need shades 
Gucci 
electric windowed over blood burst eyes 
still leaking with the ecstasy of last night

let me write about 
doing the do 
that hasn’ t been done 
to death 
quite yet 
with a little help from high street friends 
black grace on white powder 
so nesian mystical

yes, look up from your pokey poverty 
and get angry about this poem 
you’re always a gold coin koha 
away from winning lotto 
one lotu away 
from the salvation day 
and yes 
we’re halfway between 
buttnaked and never-never land 
Hawaiki 
it’s a trip 
I’ve never been able to save for 
I tell you 
stuck in rainy days all the time 
Hawaiki 
so far a lave lave away 
from us all
