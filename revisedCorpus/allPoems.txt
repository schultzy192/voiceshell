Lying on a bed with you
for at least 
the ten thousandth time 
I remember the dream 
I had last night.

You and I and the young woman
you are going to marry 
are in a shop 
choosing a jacket for you 
to wear at the wedding. 
She chooses an absurd one 
with taffeta panels on the front
and full gathered sleeves.
I see that your old one 
the one you are wearing
is plain and smart. It suits you.

In the dream I do not speak 
or act — I am there
as your friend, being reasonable
about the marriage — 
but there is a distinct
holding in my shoulders
as if our days together
are taking a shape
that I am about to reach out
and raise
above all else

a double-handled jar
in which water turns to wine.
Richard von Sturmer

Mushrooms 
The flat, black mushrooms 
grow luxurious green hair. 
Green hair edged 
with a band of white. 
Green hair as luminous 
as underwater plants. 
Green hair that can be fashioned 
into horsehair whisks.

The flat, black mushrooms 
exhale clusters of stars. 
They live in a section of the forest 
where no flies can settle.

The Great Slug 
The great slug rides his bicycle. 
His baggy pants can barely contain 
his baggy pants. 
He leaves behind 
a trail of gray foam.

The great slug is a connoisseur 
of sofas and lazy boy recliners. 
He merely rides his bicycle 
to rid himself 
of certain metallic parasites 
which inhabit the deeper recesses 
of his sagging flesh.

If only the great slug 
were a hermaphrodite. 
But his penis 
remains firmly fixed 
in the centre of his forehead.

The slug and I have a long history 
of altercations. 
He’s nothing but an impostor, 
a provocateur, 
a guzzler of kerosene. 
Someday we’ll settle old scores. 
Someday we’ll slug it out.

The Lozenge Box 
fire of flamingos 
smoke of bats 
ash of ants

On one bleak 
mid-winter’s day 
you offered me 
the key to the lozenge box 
and ever since then 
multicoloured pastilles 
continue to tumble out.

a flywheel 
a watering can 
Fidel Castro’s 
fountain pen

Multicoloured pastilles 
continue to tumble out.

The Empress of Emptiness 
What a belle, 
what an absolute 
fashion plate.

The Empress of Emptiness 
puts on her tinsel crown 
while the black bluejays 
attack her battlements 
with toothpicks 
and tape recorders.

Serious tinnitus is sweeping through 
Tintagel Castle 
and Titus has gone to ground.

The Empress of Emptiness 
gathers together her long dress 
and disappears 
down the elastic corridor.

My Uncle 
My uncle 
the acquirer of spoons 
blind as a bat 
skimming over the Astroturf.

Old polaroids 
lie scattered like tiles 
in his abandoned garden.

For a joke he once placed 
a small, cloth sailor 
inside a condom.

My uncle 
who would break into a sweat 
at the sight of a dead matchstick.

He loved the air 
the letter H 
the sound of castanets.

My uncle 
who hypnotized 
the King of Thailand

When I open the door 
to his garden shed 
sparrows fly out 
from the rusted hinges.

*

Elephants 
Elephants are never 
irrelevant. 
They use adjectives 
to extract 
honey from honeycombs.

*

Dinosaurs 
It’s wrong to compare ourselves with dinosaurs. 
Dinosaurs didn’t use power tools. 
Dinosaurs didn’t do jigsaw puzzles. 
Dinosaurs never put a man on the moon. 
They tore each other to pieces 
and fell into tar pits. 
It’s wrong to compare ourselves with dinosaurs.

André Breton’s Inflatable Octopus 
André Breton’s inflatable Octopus 
occupies a portion of Belgium. 
On Google Earth you can see the way 
it sprawls across Brussels 
with one tentacle reaching Antwerp 
and another touching Ghent.

André Breton had a penchant 
for anal eroticism. 
On the other hand 
his inflatable octopus 
is not only immaculate 
but ready, willing and able 
to release a magnificent cloud 
of perfumed ink.

*

Circadian Rhythms 
Tapping on a toadstool 
the sun comes up.

The crickets chirp 
as they go to work 
their little briefcases 
filled with sesame seeds.

Tapping on a capped tooth 
the moon goes down.

Slipped into a black folder 
then filed away 
deep in the archives 
with all the other moons.

*

Our Ancestors 
They found a billiard table 
embedded 
at the centre of an iceberg, 
proof that our Neolithic ancestors 
engaged in recreational activities.

The skeletons of hairy mammoths 
still bear the scars

of their billiard cues.

And look— 
over the horizon 
kicking up the tundra 
a great, enraged herd 
of magnetic wildebeest!

*

Captain Cook’s Hat 
There’s a tree growing 
on Captain Cook’s hat 
two trees in fact, 
one on the top 
and one on the side.

The erratic navigator 
likes to swim 
with his dorsal-finned compass

and the blue almond sky

and the blue almond sky.

AFTER THE UN RAPPORTEUR SUPPORTED MAORI CUSTOMARY RIGHTS 

If it was tattooed in Maori there’d be an indigenous Universe 
in this curvy groove—but it’s a problem of bleeding translation, 
to spit the worldview from a disembodied tongue, no shy body language, 
no pauses and swaying—a tongue like a paintbrush over eyes, face, hupe–nose 
and wide toes, broad brow (is that me you’re picturing, eh?), but 
Maori prose—that first named the land—is almost wahangū, muted. 
The verbs, nouns, adjectives, tenses, all the key teeth thrown 
on the table are English played with by the ancestors of Westminster

and Trickster, scribbled by Councillors and Scrabblers, ammo for Radical 
and Stately mouths, chucked around by cartoons of Ewen Me. English 
has boxed on for 13 centuries since Caedmon like here’s your fish and chips love; 
cuppa tea love; where’s my CliffsNotes on The Odyssey, darling? 
English was broadcast from the moon, is spoken by our family, plus 
it’s orbiting Saturn! Yet Maori liberty is still recognized by Earth.

AGNUS DEI

I carried the lamb in a sack on my horse 
the tongue hanging grey and limp. 
It’s buggered, said Dad, throw it in the creek. 
The creek leaped, dimpled. Small bubbles 
whirled, it rumpled where I was looking 
the water shadowed half-blue-black

deep just there with duckweed floating out 
the yards behind all noise, the cattle swirling 
up air swelled with dust and bellowing. 
Flies lighted on and off the rails. 
I took the lamb and kneeled in the pudgy mud 
both hands under it, under the water,

laid it carefully into the shocked cold. 
It hardly struggled, there was so little left. 
Put the bloody thing out of its misery 
I heard in my head as I pushed it under 
and the water shuddered. 
Get the hell out of that he yelled at my back

you macabre little bastard! 
It might have been ghoulish, he was good with words. 
The yards were sweating hot 
Dad wiped his hatband, the sack smelling 
of dry stiff flax, I wiped my nose 
my hand all mud and numb.

The birds hummed. In rain, in wind 
I go out all hours on my lambing beat 
he’s the shadow of me, always riding beside me. 
Let it go he said, quietly. I let it go floating 
it bobbed and the sun caught the eye, closing. 
Shush, shush, said the creek.

BEFORE WE ALL HUNG OUT IN CAFÉS

At primary school on the monkey bars 
we'd hang, aching, from the middle rung

having riffed our way along the first six bars 
then the wrench in the shoulders at the seventh.

Nowhere to go but the classroom or home 
from the patch of rubbed out grass

where the rhythm failed us.Graham Lindsay

 
  



big bed


Close the little papa’s eyes, 
close’m eyes, close’m eyes.

Sleepy baby with the goldfish lips, 
deep dark lashes, angel-pink cheeks,

ears like truffles, or hatchcovers 
for underground shelters.

Darling baby with the snotty snout, 
swept-back ‘in flight’ hair,

the tightly closed lashes 
of a president embalmed

in a coffin of dreams, under the eye 
of the gaudy activity bear,

Ellis’s Arepa Omeka —
a tattooed, rope-wristed

hand and a fish —
the poster of Barney and friends.

The curtains shuffle in an easterly.
Tamarisk feathers fade yellow, fade green

in a sea of moist air and chimney pots.
Not a palace, but cheerful,

this little house and warm. 
We have an angel in the bed with us:

chafed fluey nostrils and wide
globed brow, his right arm flung

between her face and mine,
the left left out on the covers.

Spider-red capillaries on shut lids,
Chanel lips succulent as anemones,

nipple-blistered still at twenty months.
Her ring-finger hand covers one breast.

He sucks the other and fiddles
with my penis with his foot.

BIG BOUNCE THEORY

It seems that many in the know 
now favour a variation of the proposition 
that the universe has always

breathed in and out like a giant lung— 
and shall go on doing so forever. 
There never was a start, it just goes BANG

and flies apart, then sort of reaches 
the end of its elastic and bounces back. 
Clockless time is the instrument

that swings it all—except that similes, 
metaphors and analogies don’t solve a thing. 
In fact, they screw up comprehension—

just as they’ve helped to get it wrong 
for centuries—although it has to be said 
that this is merely a trifling palpitation

of a micro-second in the greater scheme 
of things—but, damn it, there I go again. 
So it looks like we are destined comically

to create the same works without end. 
Every so-many-billion years Michelangelo 
gets another dab at it; Beethoven puts

a trumpet to his ear and blasts away. 
And it has fascinating implications: 
it’s droll to think that someone

almost like myself, not so very often, 
reassembles from a fizz of dust, 
picks up a marker, pen or chisel

and shapes letters, runes or hieroglyphs 
and generates something rather along 
these lines. Again, again, again …

Brooch

Once I discover my father has given 
a favourite eighteen-year-old medical student 
a silver pin 
crafted like an aeroplane 
and a cheque for two nights’ accommodation 
in Las Vegas 
with a handwritten card that says 
‘I wish you well in your public life, 
wish to support you in your first flight from home, 
I feel this cheque is generous,’
and I watch his hand, surprisingly slender, 
the gentle hunch of his shoulders, 
his quiet self-smile,

I wonder why I’ve never met this girl 
who I learn has hair the colour of cigarillo papers, 
voice soft as moccasins, 
skin the colour of late magnolia, 
her clothes the blue that winter shadows dye the ground

and why now I wake myself from this dream 
with the belief that the sound of weeping 
must come from the empty bedroom 
down the hall.

Burial


The shovels stood in a sticky underbelly of earth
as we stepped from the sidelines for him,
peeling our jackets, the boys loosening their ties.
Soon there was clay on our church-going gear
and his voice coming out of our childhood
coaching us to put our backs into it.
Flowers and fine words had never touched the man
like work, grunts behind a shovel’s bite,
the clean sound of clods as we heaved them in. Digging,
we bowed in memory of his stooped solid shape.
The dark damp weight of earth,
a provision, a very last word.
Ashleigh Young

CERTAIN TREES

One tree pretends to throw things 
and the wind goes sprinting, then skids, turns – 
ha! sucked in again, old wind! 

One tree chooses to be apart, 
like a door halfway up a wall. 
My window groans with the weight 

of trees 
staking their territory. Humpbacked trees, 
shipwrecks of trees 

with piano keys inside 
like the Titanic. Certain trees sway 
holding lighted leaves up 

as a voice sings out of a man 
inside my neighbour's radio 
why you on your own tonight? 
The ones you shun always come back 

to sing at you. 
Certain trees reach for a woman 
who is handing washing to the wind, a shirt 

by the arms, pants by the waist, socks 
by the feet; 
            handing over parts of the body has never 
            been so easy. 

The wind sprints past the window again 
            it gets dark quickly 
and certain trees reach for me.Helen Rickerby

                                             waterscape

a dark shape on the horizon

a girl

Her clothes are daggy 
she is not self-conscious

      Her family

The wolf

She is minding her own business

                  And there they are now 
                  talking to Mum 
                                             or Dad

She 
hates 
the stranger 
and finds them 
                  strangerly attractive 
      both at once

No wonder she is confused

         She begins to rebel 


There goes innocence

She has reached menarche 
      she reaches down

She refuses to accept this

Daughter


The Steeple Chase

Get off my back 
daughter 
this is not dancing
you have sharpened your spurs.

Get off my back
you are giving me 
the fingers 
behind my head.

Get off my back 
you have me pinned 
against the ropes 
the ref is on his tea break.

Get off my back 
I am not carrying you 
to my grave.

Get off my back 
from up there you are 
taller than me.

I will not race you 
to the finish line 
race you to freedom 
I will not count down.

I am not your competitor 
daughter 
you signed me up
without my permission.

I am not your 
leap frog.


Golden Delicious

She is sunny 
she is sunny side up, my girl 
running to meet me. 
The other girls look lumpy 
with their slumping shoulders 
dyed hair and regrowth. 
But my one is a beautiful apple 
rolling down the drive 
out past the school gates.


Blame

It is my fault 
her toenails 
her thighs 
the hideous 
hair on her arms.

My fault 
she has too many books 
it’s making her schoolbag 
fat.

Fat is my fault 
I don’t feed her 
correctly, don’t limit 
her intake.

My fault 
the failed marriage 
I am simply 
unlovable.

No money is my fault 
what sort of grown-up 
is an actress.

No brothers or sisters 
my biggest fault 
an unpardonable crime.


Babies

It’s a feast or a famine 
with sperm 
wouldn’t you say? 
Some days they can lap at your feet 
other days are shorter.

I see flakes of babies 
on hands 
on shirt fronts 
on benches 
on car back-seats

The old guy, toothless and cursing
wearing socks and jandals 
is full of babies.

The college boy 
has left babies 
on his sheets this morning.


The Unborn Ones

The brothers and sisters 
how stupid of them 
to leave it up to me.

Stupid too 
the German psychologist’s 
advice.

One child will now 
bury her parents.

The brothers and sisters 
salty baby mammals 
have returned to the sea

turning into little grey whales.


Alliteration

Bullshit, she says 
and I better bloody not be. 
I watch her b’s bounce off 
the breakfast table, 
stinging little orange and black 
bumbles 
stick to my hair.

Die die, live live


1.

A puff of air
like a lover’s
sweet speech
bubble, blue
as sky. A brown
horizon turning
fast into tomorrow
and tomorrow, etc.
Mud and leather
and a man
who runs like rubber
drawn from itself
over mud
born from
its muddy
mother field.
A kick-off
and the howl of
a moon’s dog.
They kick
the tender thing and kick and kick the tender thing
and wail and sing.
Five-nil to them.
Fuck. And fuck
the conversion
too. More
points for them.
The ball sings.
The wind
sings a hymn
down the Saint
Patrick’s Day
parade-length
of field
and the wind
blows the ball
where it shouldn’t
go. You have to
hope these idiots
grasp softness
the idea of it
its air and
innocence.
Twelve-nil to
the other side.
Conversion? No.
A rose blooms.
The fullback
there he goes
into a scrum. He’s
in the scrum
for his girlfriend
the girl he loves.
A torn ear a red rose the love-song of the fullback
a big man a
fucking giant
look at him
run. A lot of blood.
He runs for the
invisible woman.
He’s a moving tree
a flowering
tree. The Aussie
should be sin-binned.
Oh. He is.
Penalty. Twelve-
three. Tenderness
and the terrible
wind-sound
necessary for
play. They kick the tender thing and kick and kick
the tender thing
and wail and sing.
A man jumps
to his feet
throwing the hand
of his girl into
the sky. He flails
and beseeches.
Go go go go go!
It’s her envoi.
A guttural
call Moss has
never heard before
coming from
here and here
a beating on
the edge of seagull
i.e. clarinet.
There’s a rolling
maul, players
scragging faces
with sprigs. The referee
runs and blood
runs like tears.
Penalty. Twelve-six.
Go man boot
the groaning
air cradle it
as your child.
Don’t fucking
drop it idiot.
A moan goes up.
It rests in
the bodied
stadium staying
there, living on
among the people
as damage.
They kick the tender thing and kick and kick the tender thing
and wail and sing.
Rain starts. Good
for the home team
(used to it).
The visitors gnash
their teeth. Mud
sprays men
into fossils
memento mori.
They’re covered
in the game
head to foot.
Outrageous penalty
fifteen-six. Fuck.
A scrum in mud
and more rain.
The field is
ankle-glass
sometimes shattered as a dance once seen moved in water
a splish and trail
like scarves.
Half time
(FW).


2.

The land shaved
of trees made
useful by
its nakedness
and water. Men
stand as if cattle
mirrored at
a trough. A whistle
like a cast
in a roving
eye roving
over the field.
The men swarm
towards the ball
flicking earth
and sky.
The Centre’s
butchering
down the field
as a lion hunts
prey in the late
afternoon.
As a boy he
loved animals.
Off-side. Fuck.
Blood and
sweat and blood
and the crack
of bones. They kick the tender thing and kick and kick
the tender thing
and wail and sing
and wail and sing.
A man is carried
off by St John’s
Ambulance. Ah well
Fifteen-eleven
but missed the
conversion the
egg. Another
kick-off and
before long
a line-out whatever
that is. A player
hurling himself
into infinity
running and falling
and not caring
his body everything
and nothing
hovering
on the brink of
his death, death
of a small
nation. He is
a carcass
or palace. He’s carried off by St John’s Ambulance.
But there’s a penalty.
Fifteen-fourteen.
They kick
the tender thing
and kick and kick
the tender thing
and wail and sing.
Howl and a face
coated in the season
and the game
is a season
imperative
compulsory
gone again and
a girl who walks into a woman. And rain drums length
of rain
drumming.
It’s late
and the sun dips
below the cap
of cloud touching
the heads of
the crowd limning
a moment blue.
They kick
the tender thing
and kick and kick
the tender thing
and wail and sing.
On the field
blood squelches
underfoot.
Twenty-fourteen.
Paul weeps
on her shoulder.
They’ve lost.
If they’d won
there’d be
just the same
weeping like a
well a stream
or cataract. She holds his bones under her hands
his back
where wings
might once
have been.
A good man
full of tenderness
giant i.e. a lot of
tenderness.
The small mercy
of no conversion.
A minute to go.
A man runs
down the field
like a doctor
in a field hospital.
A try to us!
Forty seconds
to go. The
half-back
lines up the
wet egg
of the universe
and after some
deliberation kicks
the tender thing.
And wails.
And sings.
Converted.
The sun sinks
The whistle blows.
They won!
(i.e. We won
apparently)
Paul and his mates
leap to their feet.
Hell we won.
They leap one
by one. Fintan
leaps to his feet.
Look even
Forest is leaping
to his feet. Moss
carried away with
the win and
Paul weeping
and giants leaping
and without thinking
she stands.
She looks down
at the long body
her old favourite.
And glances up
at the great giant
there beside her
a head taller
(no matter, he will
soon go away now
the game is over
and there is just
Finnegans Wake
to read or whatever
tall tale it was).
Light from
the tall lamp casts the giant shadow of the girl over Paul.
He is bathed
in a quick new
coolness, as
dusk falls suddenly
in the Tropics
and feels it
and stares up
at the girl and
backs and backs
(the love song
of the full-back).

Disjointed on Wellington Railway Station

Where the night ends & the pallid day begins 
several dirty old groaners lie & stand around
the railway station. One sleeps, a boot under
his head, a plastic shoulder bag clutched to his
belly, his pants half down exposing a white bum . . .

I sit on a kauri bench & light up a Capstan,
place a boot on my rolled-up sleeping bag
& a free hand on top of my canvas pack.
A skinny man with a battered nose drops down
beside me, requests a smoke — his red eyes
unpicking my duffle coat, travelling over my
tennis shoes to the tailor-made cigarette in my hand.
‘Non-filter,’ I say —
‘Better than nothin’ his reply.

I light him up & give him half of what’s left of
the pack (about five) which he tucks away on the
inside of his overcoat, then runs a hand over
his smooth grey hair — the only tidy part of him.
Two mates stand off talking with another guy:
secret laughs, hands in pockets, knowing nods.
An air of deliberate disjointedness. Last night’s
close shave. An agreement to rendezvous
at an early opener later. Nervous like stage-fright
children ill at ease in a moneyed world . . .
They produce a bottle of sherry, which gets my mate
off the seat like a shot — but they don’t want
to give him a drink.

Seems he played up last night, allowed himself
to get done over by the boys — took a lot of shit
on himself. The sight of him turns the others away —
seeing themselves in his snot-smashed face, blubbery
lips & puffy eyes.
They drink the sherry, smiling, rolling back on flat
heels like heroes having come through a horrific 
night unscathed.

Another man in cowboy hat joins them, all belly
& beard, carrying a guitar. Wears moccasins — long
grey frizzy hair poking out from under the hat’s
brim, an intelligent twinkle in the eye.
But when he opens his mouth & speaks his previous
demeanour changes from something strong & sure
to something weak & gone. His speech practically
unintelligible.
One asks the cowboy where he slept last night & he
somehow conveys ‘Here’ (at the station). He gets
the poor bastard look . . .

Suddenly, they take off on separate paths (in case
they’re followed) toward the city centre, to meet up
later for tea at an all-night shelter.
My mate with the cigarettes tucked into his chest
waves a gloved hand (but not too revealingly) &
disappears in a swirl of railway grit . . .
The next time I see him (on Courtenay Place) he’s
battered more than ever, looking like he’s been
rolled. Clothes ripped, hair dishevelled, wild pale
eyes, paranoid pallor — charging apologetically
through the clean crowds heading God knows where
from God knows what.
Claire Orchard

EARLY MORNING ON THE SAND-WALK, DOWN HOUSE, MARCH 1857

Praise be for fan-tailed pigeons, for flies 
who lay their eggs in the navels of animals, 
and every parasite that clings to life,

for red-grouse the colour of heather, 
black-grouse that of peaty earth, 
for the abundance of hair on the breast of the wild turkey,

the inherited peculiarities of the horns on cattle, 
for tidal floods of starlings in massed tumblings 
across winter skies, for the plumed seed that is wafted.

Praise be for brown beetles diving in streams, 
for the wolf pack in snow, 
hard pressed for food,

for upland geese with webbed feet 
who seldom go near the water, for the beak 
and tongue of the woodpecker,

for humble bees sucking at red clover blooms, 
for each form, lightly chalked upon a wall, 
divided into great branches, oddly perfect.

Eternity

Eternity is the traffic lights at Huntly –
before they change from red to green
I am lost in the enchantment of an ancient entertainment.
A wraith-like old wooden two-storey hotel
a war memorial hall with a padlocked front door
the sour taste on my tongue of a dust and diesel railway station
miners’ cottages pale as mushrooms in the mist
a seesaw in the playground of a primary school
like scales that tilt toward injustice –
all become fantastical and floating
like some surreal craft now cut adrift by phantom boatmen.
Tilted on the river’s broad traverse
the topsy-turvy of its history
down a surface cross threaded and riddled with mysteries
wide from its flashing underbelly
its streetlights like a gorse bloom’s yellow carnival
through coal black waters voyaging this corridor of stars.
Do I merely chance to catch a glimpse of Mum and Dad
after a day out at the races
waltzing on the balcony of the Waipa Hotel –
Dad with his pockets full of fancy
the town’s wake of champagne corks and ribbons
Mum laughing as he murmurs something?
All these years later in a midsummer night’s dream
as I’m saying hullo and saying goodbye to them
waiting at the traffic lights as Huntly floats downstream.

FEAR

     I can tell you what fear is 
and when it started. 
     It's a policeman's little black book 
and what goes down in it.

     Your father told you about it 
and the consequences 
      of misdemeanour, that crimp, 
which became the book

     that grows under your skin, 
watermarks of conscience throughout, 
     contrition sharp as barley grass 
in your socks, and like confessions

     hard to extract. 'Experience 
is the best teacher,' Dad said, 
      'and we're part of yours,' 
Mum added, her eyes the colour of peat,

     except when joy dismissed 
anguish whereupon they turned 
      biscuit-brown, then lightened, 
shone like acorns. You don't find

     peace there – at least I didn't, 
and haven't – when you're downcast 
      like a colt without shoes 
standing in the fitful shade.Jenny Bornholdt

FITTER TURNER

It was a year when our bodies 
surrendered—knees, backs, lungs—listen

to your shoulder, instructed my physiotherapist, 
who was also studying English Literature

at university. Wild nights/ Wild nights she’d quote 
from Emily Dickinson as she massaged my neck

which is still sometimes sore after one parachute jump 
too many, twenty years ago. Risk was what I thought

was needed, and yes, risk was good, but I had 
a tendency to overdo it. What wrecked

my neck this time was the garden. It also 
took a toll on his lungs, which do not suffer pollen

gladly. The family cold, which hung around 
for five weeks, showed no sign of departing,

on top of which I lost my voice, which caused 
confusion at the doctors when I went after being

bitten by something in the garden. My arm 
started to swell and the inflammation crept down

towards my elbow as I struggled to explain that it 
wasn’t my lack of voice I had come about.

Pulling my sleeve up seemed to work and the doctor 
was very impressed, as was the medical student

who accompanied him. The doctor drew around the swelling— 
a shape that by this time resembled a very large and interesting

potato—and said that if it got much bigger, or if I began to feel 
unwell, I should come back up smartly. That night

the temperature plummeted. There was thunder 
and lightning and hailstones the size of marbles.

We stayed inside for the next two days, with everybody 
coughing and me unable to speak, resting my sore, red arm

while the new ceiling insulation watched over us. 
At this point I remember someone commenting on

an earlier poem of mine, which resembles this one, 
saying some people might think it’s not poetry. Well . . .

There were the colds and the neck and the lungs and 
the bite and then there was the hip, which is

connected to the knee, though not literally. 
In between is the femur which my friend Marion

has broken. I have a Dutch hache in the oven (for the purposes 
of this poem—if in fact it is a poem—I will call it

a casserole), which involves lemons and cloves and which 
I have made twice successfully, once unsuccessfully,

before. (Currently I am going through a phase where nothing 
I make tastes of anything. Or, everything I make

tastes of nothing. I hope the casserole doesn’t fall into 
this culinary hole.) Shortly after the neck came the knee,

which is where this poem really began. To explain . . . 
something happened which made me want to add

to a poem I had thought was finished. I tried, 
but I had been right in the first place—that poem had

somehow closed its doors, in the way poems do, 
so I had to begin something new.

*

My knee I injured running up stairs at the National Library. 
I knew this was not a good idea, but I was at work

on a poetry exhibition, excited, and full of a great sense 
of urgency (poetry can do this to you). All day I ran

up and down the stairs in search of books and manuscripts. 
When I woke the next morning my knee was sore

and I couldn’t bend it very easily. I felt 
an impending sense of doom. Since I was quite young

I have had bad knees—the right always worse 
than the left. At 14, I had six weeks of plaster, then

an operation, then another six weeks of plaster, after which 
my leg emerged, wasted and looking and feeling as if

it belonged to someone else. Around my knee 
was an impressive scar shaped like a question

mark. After a lot of physio and lifting weights 
made from my father’s socks filled with sand

and draped over my ankle, my knee improved. It’s years ago 
now, and although it still troubles me sometimes, mostly

it’s all right. I’m not meant to run or play sports—like tennis 
or squash—which involve sudden changes of direction.

Poetry, being low impact, is fine. After the stairs, 
I went to see the orthopaedic specialist who carved

the question mark on my knee. For the purposes of this poem 
we’ll call him Chris. (We might as well, because that’s his name.)

We talked about joints and their weaknesses and that led us 
to my father’s rare, wonky ankle, which Chris told me

had been written about in a British Medical Journal. He promised 
to find the article in the medical library and send it to me.

*

After my knee recovered and the poetry exhibition 
opened, I began writing in my shed, which is up on the lawn

at the back of our house. Am I working hard? Yes, I am. 
I’ve been writing and thinking and clearing a space

near the vegetable garden for another shed. This time 
for the children. It’s been good working to make room

for this shed, even though it’s meant some mornings spent 
with the shovel, instead of working on this poem. I’ve developed

a sore back, but nothing serious, just an ache. Like my sister 
who wrote from London to say, among other things,

that she’d hurt hers again getting off her bike.
We’re all getting older and sadder.

*

Clearing a space for the shed has meant packing 
the vegetable garden into cardboard boxes and

moving it down the steps to outside the kitchen 
door. Once the shed is built it can go back again

but I’m fearful of plants being trampled. 
Shaun—our builder—is careful, but he thinks a lot

about surfing and sometimes doesn’t watch 
where he’s putting his feet. Occasionally

he doesn’t turn up, because the southerly has dropped 
and the surf is good. I don’t mind this. I like the fact

that he also has his mind on other things. 
I knew he was all right when he walked past

the kitchen door one day and said I smell soup— 
have you got a bacon hock in that?

*

Fitter Turner is an occupation I’ve been thinking about 
lately. The words doing  just that in my head. It’s because of

my father’s ankle. I think he could’ve done with someone 
in that trade. Every day these words come to me, and then,

in the mail, comes the copy of the article about my father’s 
ankle, written when I was two. It’s entitled

Congenital ball and socket ankle joint and talks of 
a boy, aged five—my father—being admitted to hospital

with a disease of the cervical spine. This article recounts 
how, later, my father, aged 21, presented with:

a fracture of the tip 
of the lateral malleolus 
of the right ankle. 
A small effusion was present 
in the joint. A ball-and-socke t 
ankle joint was present,     
and both tibia and fibula helped    
to form the proximal articular 
surface. The scaphoid was fused 
to the talus and the cuboid 
articulated with the 4th 
metatarsal. The 5th metatarsal 
was absent. Only two cuneiforms 
were present. The second toe 
had only two phalanges. 
The right limb was almost 
1 inch shorter than the left . . . 
No abnormality was noted 
in the skull, chest, abdomen, 
pelvis, hands, knees 
and renal tract.

That came later.

The X-rays of my father′s spine, ankle and foot 
were the saddest things imaginable. I went outside

and moved some earth. For two days I did this, 
until my back ached and my knees hurt so much

I couldn’t do it any longer. I went back 
to my shed and looked at the pictures again.

For an odd moment I imagined those bones of my father’s 
in the ground. But we didn’t bury him. He burned

and became ash. When the red curtains in the crematorium 
shushed closed to conceal his coffin, our son called out

hey!—startled by the trick of it all.      Hey!      it was what 
we all wanted to say. The ash my father became

was shocking in its greyness and grittiness. 
We scooped handfuls and scattered what he now was

on the ground. What more can you say about this? 
Hey!

That it is not the worst thing that can happen?

*

In the middle of writing this poem I had a dream 
I was wrestling with the ghost of Katherine

Mansfield. A friend suggested it was a poem 
I was struggling with. Yes. This one. Which I know

seems very plain and straightforward and 
conversational, but it’s taken a lot to get it

this way. Today I will take the casserole to Marion 
who can now manage on one crutch, which is good,

because her husband (who coached the rowing crew 
I was coxswain for, after being told I shouldn’t row

on account of my knees) is about to have a knee 
replacement and she needs to be able to get around.

Tomorrow I fly to Nelson. I don’t like flying, 
but I will grit my teeth and get on the plane.

Last time I flew on a small plane, 
the pilot said before take-off Lifejackets

are under your seats. If anything happens, put them 
on. Don’t wait for me to tell you what to do

because I’ll be out of here. In Nelson I will be met 
by a woman who describes herself as having

‘the ponytail of indifference’. I look forward 
to this. She will drive me to the Rosy Glow

Chocolate Shop, above which I will stay. I will 
lie down on the comfortable bed, then I will

get up and go and read some poems. Later 
I will go to a Haydn Mass with the woman

with the ponytail, who will sleep a beautiful, 
attentive sleep through the third and fourth movements.

Next morning I will buy some chocolates from 
Rosy Glow and go to the airport in a taxi driven by

‘Dickie’ who has woken up deaf in one ear. 
Maybe the doctor? I will yell. Twelve thirty

he’ll reply, then pass me a mint. I’ll head home 
on a plane flown by a pilot who doesn’t know

his left from his right, and from the air I’ll see 
our house and my shed and the frame

of the new shed taking shape by the vegetable garden. 
The weather will be beautiful and I’ll remember

that today is the day a friend may learn that his life 
will be shorter than he would ever wish. Two friends

will tell me their mothers are dying. My son 
will collect a cricket bat in the face and his eye

will turn the colours of evening. To pass the time 
at the hospital he will ask me to list the things

that never end: space, time, the universe, 
dogs barking at the mailman, numbers, weather,

fear, love, kindness, television, Haydn’s mass . . . 
Then a doctor will come, and because we live

in a very small pocket in the great big frock 
of the world, he will be the chairman of my son’s

school board of trustees. He is a kind man and a good 
doctor, and he will patch up my son’s cheek and we’ll

head home. On the way I will think about the poetry 
reading and how, beforehand, I met a man who makes

furniture, but originally trained as a fitter and 
turner. Do I know what that is? And how,

in the middle of the reading, I glanced down at my book 
and a tiny green preying mantis

scrambled bright and awkward over the page. 
I will tell my son about this. He will suggest

I might have carried the insect in my bag, all the way 
from Wellington, all the way from the vegetable garden

in boxes, and I’ll say yes, I might have. And we’ll agree 
that wherever it came from, it seems like a good sign.

And we’ll drive home—his eye matching sky—which is 
an easy rhyme, but pleasing, to me, nevertheless.

Golden Weather (Cook Strait)


Nana died on Boxing Day 
we left Makara in kayaks

we paddled all night, we paddled away 
Dad steered to the Southern Cross

we lashed the dog to a boogie board 
and ate cold cheerios with tomato sauce

Porpoises played as we packed our sad 
at dawn we skimmed the swells

the yellow Lab sank beneath the waves 
Farewell, wept Mum, farewell.

At high noon Nana was bronzed 
we swallowed grief and sausage rolls

Not before time we left for home 
we turned our backs on the day

goodbye, we cried, you golden sun! 
goodbye, goodbye, you yellow dog!

Goldfish


My son doesn’t go to school 
any more he goes somewhere
else. He goes out walking alone
with his hat on his head, 
lies on a bed, where they slip 
a drip to the vein and
he has his body pumped full. 
Funny how they grow up 
says the woman who is the chemist, 
Is it your only one? 
It’s harder then because you’ve spoilt them 
here’s your prescription, forty nine dollars. 
I try to pretend 
she doesn’t know a thing, a thing that she’s saying. 
Here’s a red light outside 
and I have to stop, and everywhere there’s children 
a reminder of the way we come 
into the world, birth, growth, 
and end up fat or thin. 
He, my own, was thin before 
the drugs set in and made him fat, 
now he looks like a frog. 
There’s a dog on the way home 
so I pat it, sign of the hope 
I have for the future. 
When I get in he’s on the bed 
I can tell he feels bad, don’t
he says. He often says that. 
Or come here and he holds my 
hand and there we are, two 
tiny pebbles perched on the edge, 
with the silvery sand far below us. 
We don’t like to use the C-word 
says one white coat. 
They prefer the ambiguous 
nodes to tumours, or even 
bumps and lumps, if you were dumb 
you might think you had mumps. 
ln ward one he starts to tell me 
his dream: we are chased 
by a giant goldfish, we reach 
a cellar, we are trapped 
by the goggle-eyed fish in a dead 
sea end, and then suddenly 
he is all alone with an enormous 
tome on his lap, the words medical 
dictionary are embossed on its cover, 
and he opens it, and he begins to read.

HAT

Dad wouldn't be seen dead 
without a hat. 
Farm hat, summer hat, town hat 
even when he had hair.

Hat on an angle, hat on horse, 
hat in the truck with dogs.

We fished by stealth 
stalked trout 
with a spear and a light. 
He wore his hat in the dark.

A mile apart by metal road 
my grandmother lived 
on her half of the farm. 
No chance meetings, not even 
a skyline sighting.

She lay in wait in town 
watched 
from the haberdashery 
as he walked up the street. 
She came out as if by accident. 
Hand frail, and clasping 
the front of her coat, 
she gave a coy look 
from the bags of her bloodhound eyes— 
the whole air stopped

he raised his hat, went past.

Fleur Adcock

HAVING SEX WITH THE DEAD

How can it be reprehensible? 
The looks on their dead faces, as they plunge 
into you, your hand circling a column

of one-time flesh and pulsing blood that now 
has long been ash and dispersed chemicals. 
The half-glimpsed mirror over their shoulders.

This one on the floor of his sitting-room 
unexpectedly, one far afternoon; 
that one whose house you broke into, climbing

through his bathroom window after a row. 
The one who called you a mermaid; the one 
who was gay, really, but you both forgot.

They have all forgotten now: forgotten 
you and their wives and the other mermaids 
who slithered in their beds and took their breath.

Disentangle your fingers from their hair. 
Let them float away, like Hylas after 
the nymphs dragged him gurgling into the pool.

LIFE-DRAWING CLASS

The book said if you wanted a cow 
you drew the cow. 
And if you wanted the milk 
you drew the milk. 
And if you didn’t want that snowflake anymore 
you simply joined the points together 
to make a spider’s web.

On the course, the advanced students would draw the sun 
then smudge the edge of the circle 
to warm up the room. 
The same technique made a static star shoot, 
then you could wish on it—for anything. 
I sensed the power of what I was learning.

There was one rule: you couldn’t erase. 
If you didn’t like something you drew, 
if the elbows of that tree were stabbing birds, 
you had to keep drawing. 
'Draw again. Draw better.’ was the brand’s tagline.

But if an online class has a back corner, then I was in it. 
I was flailing in a whirlpool of my own sketching. 
I had to draw my mum to get me out.

As she spoke, full of concern, 
I drew some coins: soothing, repetitious rounds. 
Mum recited my student debt (my age plus three zeros), 
and lack of pitched roof, weatherproof shoes, pot-luck dinner invites.

Boy, those coins were really mounting up! 
I ran their coolness through my fingers. 
Mum tested the metal with her teeth.

Every pencil in my pocket—HB, 2B— 
well I threw them away like crutches. 
Then I filled my pockets with my new wealth.

When I drew the river and walked into it, 
those coins worked better than stones.

a man kisses the pieta

all night the wind

wraps itself around the city

not ring in danger but prayer 
and genya’s voice

falls from a clock 
as she calls her children

kazia, stefan, hendrich, janek 
her hand closes around

LINES FOR A NEW YEAR

I like the branch 
I find myself on

a view over the garden 
all the way down to the beach

the family below me 
gathered in the garden

debating where I’ve gone. 
My father’s got a theory.

I like the branch 
I find myself on.

*

You know how it is

to give up the piss 
a week to the

day before Christmas

you know how it is

to fall over sober 
safe in some spot,

come to later 
remembering the lot.

*

the rugby ball kicked 
far as the far paddock

where an apple tree caught it. 
Was agreed among folk

they’d never seen such a catch, 
such a kick, such a match.

*

I gave it away lately 
I had no choice, 
no need pump the brakes— 
they’d already seized.

I like your poison, lady, 
I like it too much: 
which is why I am 
          where I am today 
outside of thought, beyond your touch.

I said I’ll be seeing you. 
You knew what I meant, 
at least you seemed to. 
Was the message you got 
the same one I sent?

*

It’s a love song 
between a mother and son.

The son plays the drums 
and wrote the song.

On the recording 
mother sings the song

like mothers do. And the 
son plays the drums

like a good boy. It′s a 
love song.

*

A friend used to say 
my dog and I 
had the same way of walking,

especially walking away. 
Which was 
often the case.

These days there’s 
not much happening. 
It’s people walking toward me

asking, where’s the dog, 
the dog? And they’re 
right. Where is he?

*

You live in this world 
you have no choice. 
Silence would be fine. 
But you give it voice—

you have to, you cannot 
help yourself. 
Your mother says you never knew 
when enough was enough.

*

Dreamt I met Thomas Hardy 
walking a local back road. 
He was an old man 
but coped okay with his cane.

He said he was looking for 
a woman called Lizbie Brown. 
I said I knew her name— 
but only from his poem.

*

Sitting on a clifftop 
was always a dream 
that more or less came true. 
Just the words dried up.

*

Friends disappear 
off the face of the earth. 
For what it’s worth 
I loved you. 
But you can’t hear.

*

Is said (what few 
elders we have left) 
anyone for whom birds sing 
all night through to dawn

are themselves 
close to eternal bird-song: 
their time, among these branches, 
that of the elders—not long.

*

If this were the view 
I got all year through— 
a branch of a tree at the window—

I would become that 
branch of tree and with it 
grow.

The nurses agree 
I never complain 
about the rain, or pain.

Easy, when you know 
you’re a tree 
at the window.

*

When I poured her a cup of tea 
and asked her, strong or weak? 
she held out a dark wrist: 
same colour as this.

*

I’m off to look at angels. 
And toetoe if I see it.

The family move in close. 
No way out but

close my eyes to see

if anything’s left of the toetoe, 
and the angels.
John Dennison

LONE KAURI (REPRISE)

So take for starters the surge-black fissure, 
the waves which register the lunatic sense 
it is all well beyond us. Our flooded nature

rages at the dying light, measures 
its measures down some lone goat-track, 
works up some incorrigible reprise

on grace, etc., a tuning fork 
striking itself out of true on the table 
of the elements. But blow, burn, break

and be done with it: baptism will 
look like this, the flailing, the flensing of waves 
and the breath knocked into you, the haul

that finds you first-footing land, brings 
the morning. Forgive my making light of 
the glass half-empty and you weighing up the dregs;

but I will get up like a love-cast father 
awakening to children’s voices, the night- 
time true underfoot, who hears their laughter

and finds, at the unclosed door, the seam of light.

Making Waves

for Maurice Wilkins

Light diffracted on a bedroom wall
at 30 Kelburn Parade, making waves
through a cloth blind, circa 1920;
outside, pongas and cabbage trees
lie just within memory’s range,
a pattern and a shadow.
The silence here is qualified
but it draws you out, four years old, 
or five. The world’s a single room
where fronds and wind tap a code
against the window pane.

Next up you’re wild, sprinting down 
a helix of concrete steps 
from the hills to the harbour. 
Or you’re leaning into a gale
commensurate to your incline 
and weight; the elements support you,
and the blustery horizon
is fresh with new information.

**

And now the landscape changes 
from island to continent to island again,
and there’s a sea-change as we fire off
certain rays to form a transverse 
across your history. 
                                          Acclimatised, 
you wintered over in laboratories 
and made a virtue of basements
and arcane knowledge; you found
a scientific silence or a calm
in which things are worked out
at a snail’s pace, a slime 
stretched and scrutinized between
forefinger and thumb to yield
a feast of the truth, or a field 
ploughed with frustration, if that 
is where our guesses land us. 
For Science is a railway carriage 
rocking with big ideas, sometimes 
stalled on the sidings or slowed 
on branch lines near rural stations. 
And still the whole is too huge for us
to comprehend, one metre long, 
wrapped around each cell,
unread until it’s unwound,
the scarf and valence of our complexity, 
from which we derive our unique timbre 
to say: Well done! Well done!

**

To an amateur an x-ray plate 
looks like an old fashioned
gramophone disk: yet it plays
scratchy music of the spheres,
jazz of an original order.
Or perhaps it’s the ground-section 
of a Byzantine cathedral, or a basilica 
of double colonnades and semi-circular apse
— and who builds upwards from that 
to discover the grand design? Who
constructs with only a floor plan
to find the elevations? 
                                                      Those
who are neither architects nor masons
but quiet archaeologists of the unseen
hand and mind of God, digging upwards 
to the exquisite airy construction 
of the double helix. Gifted clumsiness? 
Genius? You are there at the start of it,
a chiropractor of the biophysical,
clicking the backbone of DNA into place.

MISS RED IN JAPAN 

I make telephone calls 
to my bones, eat evenings 
full of 12–year–old 
video credits.

Crows snap black 
on power lines, shine 
beaks inside my leaf window.

My childhood home 
is coffee cans, a frying pan 
on the living room floor.

Mum is a Moritz stick. 
The stove is a piece of dried seaweed.

At night I cover mother 
in a yellow plastic hard hat. 
‘Goodnight dad,’ I call out.

The road is dancing. 
In the dark I salute 
packets of HOPE 
cigarettes inside 
spacelight 
roadside machines.

I was just a tourist in those mountains. I drove wildly down steep
slopes through gorges and cascades. After the brutal descent, I
arrived at a belvedere with a breath-taking view.

I will tell you something: In 1897, three fragments of broken jug
were discovered in Egypt. They were 3000 years old. Poems were
painted on the fragments. One of them is
                    the poet smells his lover’s shirt . . .
In 1951, French Egyptologists found twenty-eight more pieces of
the same jug and the rest of the poem was restored
                    that sniff of sweetness instantly
                                        transports him to the South Seas

O Rio dos Poetas

I met a sage in a state of bliss
who subsisted on a glass of milk each day.
Below him stretched a great emptiness
carved out of existence, the head-waters
of the Mondego River.
A short distance away was
the birthplace of the ‘discoverer’ of Brazil.

  5 
My father died in December.
With my brothers I carried him
to the low house reserved
for dead soldiers.
When it was my turn to speak
I recalled driving though green paddocks
in his Chevrolet,
the road driving into my eyes.
It was the first day of the holidays.
We got lost in the traffic
and separated from the cortege
so we stopped for sandwiches and beer
and played billiards in a club.
A band was set up to play
but after a dispute with the management
they took their gear away.
I hope I never
I hope I never
see that part of Auckland again.

  6 
Language is my neighbourhood.
I live in Alphabet City.
The people who live here open their hearts to the sun.

Today was the birthday of Louis Braille, the inventor of a reading
system for the blind,
the day the sputnik fell back to Earth.

My horoscope says:
‘Writing frequently will help you sustain a relationship with
someone at a distance.’

  7
At night I watch the moon and imagine exciting places 
over the horizon. Only a fool does not see that the vast 
industrial economies are temporary. I say too much. My 
throat is infected with words. At the country hospital, I am 
treated by a beautiful doctor. That evening we drink wine 
from the valley on the balcony of the hotel. Look, she says, 
the moon is moving into the distance, three centimetres 
each year, which is the speed at which fingernails grow! 
We sing revolutionary songs until all hours, drinking to 
friendship between our two countries. In her language, the 
word for ‘Sunday’ is ‘resurrection’. I leave the following 
morning.

  8
This existence is not original.
          Like love itself,
the universe is mostly smoke and mirrors,
          I am I,
the beginning of illusion.
          You are you,
the centre of confusion.
          I write to you alone at night,
speaking into the silence.
Kate Camp

MUTE SONG

i


The first time I saw you 
I don’t know which I loved more 
you with your tranquil neck 
calmly transporting yourself through the world 
or the one who followed you everywhere 
trolling the dark waters like a hook.


ii


The strange thing was that 
as each other’s opposite and negative 
we were even visible 
I with my tatty winter coat 
smelling of reeds 
you consisting entirely of surfaces 
or should I say one fabulously curved surface 
smooth and white as an egg.


iii


I have no idea what you saw when you looked at me 
a shadow dully pursued by the shape that cast it 
a placeholder reserving a space from nonexistence. 
Perhaps you saw God’s fearsome ability 
to be absent, his morosely taken option 
to hoard his riches in another universe. 
In anyone else, such a thought would be absurd. 
In your case, it was luminous and adorable 
shining in the dark location known as me.


iv


It was inevitable I would follow you 
the sound of laughing that came 
though you never laughed 
the sweet nonsensical conversations 
in which you remained impassively silent 
the pointless journeys you took 
your eyes perfectly round. 
My desire was the desire to be superlative 
I, who had spent years in domestic craft 
became selfishly single-minded as an artist 
inflicting your beauty on myself 
like some ecstatic adolescent 
cutting her arm with a pocket knife.


v


At night I would disappear. 
You and the moon would glow. 
I hated to think of the dark 
covering you over like a mouth.
Michele Leggott

NICE FEIJOAS

sometimes you meet the title

NOT ANOTHER NAFANUA POEM

Not another nafanua poem she can hear them say as she attempts to ride the 
current of her culture in the new millennium with her electric waka I’m afraid 
so her shadow answers back in black but this ride’s for nua’s sister the one 
who stayed home and fed her father koko alaisa wiping his chin and fetching 
the key for the cupboard holding the toilet pepa for the faleuila outside while 
her famous warrior sister slay the stereotypes on an oceanic scale I’m afraid so 
because this is the story of how her sister had to replace the stolen coconuts 
meant for that evening’s saka that the warrior took without asking to cover her 
womanhood I’m afraid so because someone had to feed the aiga harvest the 
kalo the bananas the pawpaw bagging them and dragging them to makeke fou 
to sell for kupe to pay the government school for the kids to get a scholarship 
up and out of here so they can come back and open a restaurant in apia and 
finally begin to tap into those rivulets of capitalism spilling over and into the 
sewers and into the streets and into the back roads of the kua back villages 
except for nafanua’s village someone has to tell said the shadow.

Ophelia
For Guy Williams


1. That moment

There comes a moment
when you don’t know where you end 
and the creature in your arms begins.

The long rains. 
Two years on from the accident 
and the day after my sister left —
the day we knew we could be lovers no more 
than sun and moon embrace the cradled earth.

I almost missed it in the market, 
the monsoon slapping down, 
but turned to see what I’d ignored: 
wrapped in a faded, torn kikoy, a wriggle 
and her hopeless eyes staring into me:

and all of Africa’s anger and sex and wildness 
were riding in there.


2. The price

And there she was —
a baboon, 
I said —
and not one of the blue baboons 
you find upcountry 
but a golden baboon from the coast, 
a six-week-old Monroe blonde

who was already in my arms, 
her little hands fast around the buttons of my shirt.

Unotoka wapi?
(Where d’you get her?) 
I asked the Giriama —
one of the untouchable bushmen 
of the coast —
                              he’d shot her mother, 
drugged her with arrows to feed alive 
to his pet python

and I bought her there and then, 
for a ten bob cheque 
written in pencil
                                   which bounced.


3. Her name


Why did I give her such a tragic name? 
Perhaps it was the Hamlet I’d just done 
but more to the point — at only fifteen 
I guess I’d guessed what was to come;

and she as motherless as me 
that when I stared into her eyes —
and it’s this that I want to remember —
that look when you look into an animal

and see your own soul’s country 
deep in there, beyond the dark horizon. 
And she brought me flowers, petals from the garden, 
and her moon-coloured cries at night.


4. Food

Whatever I ate, she ate — and from my bowl: 
stone-sized chunks of aloneness 
and whatever else my father’s allowance allowed. 
Sometimes an arm of grass, poured on a silver plate 
from which her shining black fingers deftly sorted 
all the seeds, which she ate 
like a queen, buzzing away to herself, 
while I lay on the sofa 
smoking.


5. Tricks

Tricks? Yes, she could do tricks: 
she could outdrink anyone in the New Stanley, 
pints of Elephant beer, though once 
so drunk she jumped on Jack Block’s head —
the owner deep in concentrated talk 
trying to sell the place again. 
Why him? 
He banned us for ever then.

And her noise a wonder in my bed at night.

But it wasn’t her tricks so much 
as just her being there: 
at the chai kiosks and foodcarts of River Rd. 
we ate African for free 
sikuma wiki, posho, mukate maiyai —
for the punters we brought in.

And once, her first time on heat, 
I woke in the dark to find her 
gently
              sweetly 
wanking us off —
both of us together.


6. Inner child

Stare into her eyes —
the fires and shining greens, the night’s bright gems.

Do we reflect each other? Yes, we reflect each other —
but I want to enter that look and live in there for ever 
to know what the child inside her thinks of me 
and this other country, this dream I’ve brought her to.

And we stared into each other’s eyes —
       careless because we didn’t care 
       fearless because there was nothing to fear 
       but the death we both inhabited

laughing as we waited for the final act —
       like I was her Player King 
       and she my Player Queen.


7. Abuse

But it wasn’t all roses. 
Have you ever tried 
to house-train a baboon?

Shit everywhere. In our bed 
at night, in the kitchen: 
the houseboy fled after two days.

The old soliloquies of abuse: 
I cursed her, I wished her gone —
away into the prayers and habits of

white silence.
                             And was it physical abuse?

Yes, it was physical abuse: 
I rubbed her face in it. 
I beat her. 
I locked her in the toilet

where Africa’s tongue accused me, 
screaming her wonderful noise.


8. A story

My little put-put, my 50cc Yamaha —
that’s how she travelled, riding pillion, 
clinging to my waist, slipped inside my shirt.

Langata Rd., 4 a.m. — army roadblock: 
spikes and chains, and cavalettis on the road 
like a riding school.

The soldiers relax around me, smiling: 
Habari aku, bwana? Pleasantries of the black night —
no matter this mzungu on a bike.

Then, her tail twitches and stands up 
on the seat behind me — like a rod: Shaitani! 
Shaitani! Devil! and their guns all cocked at me.

‘Hey, whoa . . .’ holding to the softness in my voice. 
‘It’s only my baboon’ — and as always in Africa 
the childlike roar of laughter at ourselves

and friends for life, for ever.


9. What was to come

The Ministry of Wildlife was on to me. 
My friends were on to me. My sister 
was on to me, and the houseboys.

Through it all, Ophelia muttered at nothing. 
She picked the lice from my hair. 
She brought me avocados from high up the tree —

their dark jade glowing in her shiny black palms, 
in the creases of her fingers.


10. For ever

What is time to a baboon?

What did it mean to those eyes 
that followed me from room to room, 
or through the shantytowns 
and Arab Quarter alleys 
where children play soccer in the dust 
and call for her, and follow her, 
who followed me.

And even when she wasn’t there, 
when I locked her in the bathroom, 
I could feel her gargoyle eyes on me, 
the scrutiny that wildness grants —
to have this second sight with me.

But I don’t know what time meant to her, 
though if I had to guess 
I’d say it meant simply this: 
that we were there, together in that moment

and that the passing of each moment 
was for ever, or is for ever 
in the present simple tense to her.


11. Husband

I had to do something.
A ‘husband’ must be found for her.
A born-free solution. After all, 
this was Adamson Land.

I took her to a farm in Macharkos —
Eden Hill. For three weeks I climbed 
through trees with her, 
teaching her to swing through them —
to teach her to survive.

And then I betrayed her twice on paper: 
I divorced her with my signature. 
I gave up such rights as I was said to have 
and read again my traitor’s name —
printed in carbon on a BOAC ticket,

bound for England.


12. Bees

Under the flyover, a council flat in Hammersmith, 
where the letter came, falling like an autumn leaf, 
wrapped in someone’s white bandages.

It said that she’d been killed by bees, 
stung to death, 
trying to rob their honey.

I wept. I didn’t want to believe. 
I couldn’t weep her out of me.
I wept her out of me.


13. Baboonery

Time knows many ways of passing.

A yew tree in the graveyard at Stoke Gabriel —
green smoke of its branches 
hangs above the tombs. 
Its roots are said to feed in every grave.

Carvings on the church door. 
The gargoyle style
                                       they call baboonery —
how is it I forget you, 
Ophelia, 
for all of thirty years?

I look up at the stone faces: 
a worn-out Herne the Hunter, 
the wild hunt searching for souls —

and hold you as I come into myself, 
feeding on that moment

where I don’t know where I end

and the baboon in my arms begins.

Our trip to Takaka


Well, we went to Takaka
for the weekend
and there was this spring.
Yes.
This spring.
And we could see under the
water with this mirror thing.
And there was this eel.
Yes.
This eel, swimming from right 
to left like a reel of silk ribbon,
like a pennant waving.
You know: a pennant,
with teeth and an eye like a
silver stud among all this 
pondweed. And there were
all these bubbles. Each one 
was like a little world 
rising in its sleek skin.
And then we went to see
the goldfields.
Yes.
Goldfields.
And there were these caves
in scrubland. They’d stripped
the hills till the ground ran red.
And we went into one of the
caves and there was this young 
man sleeping on fern fronds, 
meditating to make the world 
well. He had his dog with him. 
Yes.
His dog.
That’s how we knew he was there.
The cave was deep, like an ear.
Or a belly button. It was deep and
damp, and we heard the dog bark
down in the dark and a young man 
saying, “Be quiet!” 
The clay in the cave stuck 
to our hands like dry blood. 
We gave the young man a 
bread roll.
Yes.
A bread roll.
With cheese and egg. And we 
said, Well, good luck with the 
meditating and everything. 
He said, yeah, well, he was 
going to give it his best shot.
Then we drove home.
Yes.
Home.

That was our trip to Takaka.

Parachute


She would never have jumped alone and seeing
the world like an immense crevice she might
have abandoned the tandem jump if the
instructor hadn’t had Greek god genes. He
smiled at her reassuringly, she nodded
and they were off, her fear turned to delight
with the motorcycle which gravity
had given them. She approved his delay
in pulling the cord. Then she realised he
was pulling the cord. She’d picked Icarus
instead of a god. “Keep calm,” he yelled. Next,
more quietly, “Sorry.” She scanned the ground for
haystacks piled ten high. She looked up and caught
a glimpse of the plane, a mocking feather.

RIPPLES

The computer is dead; long live the computer.  
In the meantime I write by hand. 

Across the road has appeared a For Sale sign  
in long grass beside the toetoe in the empty section.  
In the middle distance, wind-burned iron roofs chafed by macrocarpa,  
wooden power poles, manuka, the Challenge garage,  
cars on the bridge  
to the island harbour, containers, cranes, warehouses,  
fishing boats, ships. 

Stockpiled woodchips, tawny forests piled like salt.  
Moon-grey sheep-fold in a stony pasture.  
The far shore underlines blue mountains.  
Across the harbour against the sinuous ranges  
stands a white and grey Lego block,  
the new milk powder plant, fifteen minutes on the arc by road  
from here to there. When my eyes sweep the horizon  
they come across a Lego block where there was none. 

In the slow ground boulders grow.  
Silvered timbers fold the sheep.  
Cloud cliffs over Konini, five miles high from west to east.  
Agate pebble in my palm  
feels like rhyme to my warm skin.  
Five dimensions coiled inside, colour deepened by my tongue. 

I see Hone with clarity.  
The bronze sheen of his skin,  
tapering fingers, hand on my arm.  
He might be just up the road at Kaka Point. 

Alone within alone.  
Petrified whalebone. 

Tui twangs, triggers ripples.  
Under the wilding branches magnified sepia leaf-shadows  
play on viridian mosses, rusty iron, ferns, rotten logs.  
Pile dead branches and jump on them.  
In shade and shattered light dull logs crack, twigs snap.  
Floored with leaf-mould, fern, deep loam, this is the hut. 

In koromiko shade an iridescent diagram,  
fine landing strip, concentric trap,  
text between twigs, arachnid syntax,  
parlour game in a gossamer field  
of forty radii, seven anchors, three strong horizontals.  
Along these lines slide spectral parallactic gleams. 

I fell in the window. He was asleep in front of the potbelly.  
Deaf smile, shining-eyed surprise –  
I was afraid you might have burned your legs.  
After the funeral service you leaned down towards me out of a cloud;  
‘Kia mau!’ you shouted into my mind. 

You might be talking with Joanna.  
There she is in a red coat arriving on the ferry.  
I watch her painting watercolours. Colours bless the paper.  
‘A shape to part the space,’ she smiles, ‘Morandi.’  
Quietly, she is gone. 

Dawn or dusk? I can’t quite hear what they are saying,  
I can’t get a handle on them, they pull away like water.  
Swirling kelp wind, cabbage trees green-faced wildcats.  
The house bangs like a cardboard box.  
It’s calm in here.  
Some shells empty, some shells full.  
My friends talking quietly, just out of ear-shot. 

Mist fills the harbour.  
Only the tip of the smelter chimney is showing,  
a black accidental on white. The long wharf juts hatched across nothing.  
Straight lines and clustered blocks, taupe, beige, aluminium,  
blend with the sand, sea, isabelline sky. 

I was astral travelling.  
Set in the middle knuckle of his hand  
a round World, deep blue and green, a jewel,  
a navigation device.  
He stretched his arm and we flew beyond the Last Scattering,  
beyond the primal molecules  
where Nothing warps at the approach of light. 

Soul wrapped in a mystery. 

Don’t worry, when the planet is completely wrecked

the seas will deepen for a time until they disappear in mist  
and we are left like Mars.  
The last of us might carve some mighty lines in Earth  
like Nazcar lines – or Boreray – scrape off the turf  
to leave a message on the hill, visible from Hirta –  
great navigation lines that point through space  
to join with other lines,  
our landing strips on some green other world. 

There is no malice in the computer,  
nor inclination towards good.  
In language ether particles form;  
word behaviours give thought tongue  
in codes and keys – 

Then there is an earthquake.  
The kitchen cupboards judder as if a tractor drove across the roof  
windows struggling panes/ what if/ disrupted/ the cupboards  
tumbled/ the piles  
collapsed/ the tidal wave impending/ giant broccoli/ without malice/ keys and codes in tongue  
Certainly uncaring. I need Bell tea, for Earl Grey is insipid.  
In the kitchen hot teabag juice through fingers,  
dropped in the sink a dry bud. 

Cosmic code winks on power lines after the billions of rain.  
Legs piston past on the white Staffy, Oscar. 

Bidibids, snags, pulled threads,  
flaws in the weave, points de repère.  
Can’t be sure of molecules making us up momently  
whose memory expands with time  
and over time the mind  
caught on a detail, thorn, spark, madeleine, opening  
a bubble  
torus 
wormhole;  
via chance harmonics,  
pools of connection, shocks and ripples,  
traversing dimensions. 

A shape to part the space – 

The edges are shy and to be approached with caution  
lest they lose their inner concentration, become self-conscious  
in the Adam-and-Eve effect  
slip through a gap, perhaps,  
change phase – subject to object,  
innocence to experience, perhaps. 

So turn stone  
over  
on the tongue. 
Chris Price 
  
 

Rose and fell

Moist geometry unfurls.
          Dawn flushes the birds 
from their silence

— hectic petticoats trimmed 
          with disappearing mist —
and there, under a shaggy hem

          of pines, the monster Grendel
stealing home, mouth full 
          of pinking shears.

His rough palm grips the bruised
          root of a plant torn 
from a mountainside

          releasing scent of a more
legendary bloom. 
                              His pelt

glistens, the girl’s words 
          trapped moths
in his uncomprehending ears.

Wings of flowers 
               fall and star 
the path behind him

          as he travels
swiftly over the ground 
          breathing     breathing.

‘SACRED DAYS’

How I stalled, 
hiding inside my head, 
liking it there, cushioned. 
Being in the world 
as it was unfolding,

with the sun shining neat 
on to footpaths, the rain's 
dribble on to hedges 
and patient mail-boxes, 
the smell of cooped-up budgies,

the deep, warm bath 
nine o'clock at night, 
the creak of the passage; 
all things that cluster 
to form a town were bearable

if the edges were woolly 
with fabrications. Rhododendrons 
and marigolds to soften front yards. 
The high school's highly-polished corridors, 
shadowed bike-sheds,

lagged pipes in the pre-fabs. 
The sound of clocks, of wooden walls 
relaxing behind wallpaper. 
The smell of coal. 
All framework for dreams.

Oh and let's not forget 
the heartbreak, the heartbreak 
of newly-mown grass, 
of any and every awful beauty. 
Yes, and that ache

of double-hung windows, 
of looking out at a world where hills 
meet sky; the outside world, 
its whole big, blue bluster, 
its yodel and strut. Karlo Mila

 
  


Sacred Pulu


let me rip off 
your images 
and write about the bleeding beetroot pink purity 
of Cook Islands potato salad 
melting into subtropical mango horizons, 
let me crap on poetically papaya 
inhaling the bottle blonde fragrance of gardenia 
let me pop some pods of vanilla 
and talk dried banana bullshit

let me write about 
the mountains of Manu’a 
from the flats of Mangere town centre 
let me shower you 
with falling frangipani fakeness 
$2 a lei from a Chinese shop in Otahu 
let me keep it real 
with the bitterness of lime from Foodtown $15.99 a kg 
for raw fish ota ika perfection

let me bowl you a type of stereo 
that sings lotto-ad-styles 
hula hip hop 
wop de fob 
fresh fresh fresh 
out of the deep freeze

let me scream a Niuean chant 
like Xena 
and slap my chest ma’ulu’ulu style 
till my Wonderbra sings like a coconut 
let me siva you away like Sosefina 
last song, feeling up the dancefloor

let me romanticise us 
away from
the grubby white sneaker existence 
stuck to chewing gum of Otara markets 
carried into the CBD of Saturday night 
the fruit is so bright 
we need shades 
Gucci 
electric windowed over blood burst eyes 
still leaking with the ecstasy of last night

let me write about 
doing the do 
that hasn’ t been done 
to death 
quite yet 
with a little help from high street friends 
black grace on white powder 
so nesian mystical

yes, look up from your pokey poverty 
and get angry about this poem 
you’re always a gold coin koha 
away from winning lotto 
one lotu away 
from the salvation day 
and yes 
we’re halfway between 
buttnaked and never-never land 
Hawaiki 
it’s a trip 
I’ve never been able to save for 
I tell you 
stuck in rainy days all the time 
Hawaiki 
so far a lave lave away 
from us all

Seven Unposted Postcards to My Brother


1.

Turn fifty, Steve, 
and it all slides into view! 
And why when one gets old 
must one look so hideous? 
While lingering of course 
in some grotty council flat 
with basketball at midnight in the halls?

Better by far 
to live life backwards 
from the grave to the cradle.


2.

Tamar Street and Kneebone’s butchery,
saveloys and shillings for the gas.

I had the top bunk. 
A cheapish crucifix 
with a skinny, tinny Christ 
had been fixed to the wall above my pillow; 
up there with me too 
were a Mitchell bomber, The Satan Bug
and a book on conjuring.

I’d never be so weIl equipped again.


3.

Landing now and then a mucoid sprat, 
we’d fish a brown lagoon 
in which had somehow sunk 
a girthsome boiler fouled by mustard rusts.

Or I’d take you to the pictures.


4.

Sculpted curtains stained 
by lights of lime or rose.

Ben-Hur and Billy Budd and Bullitt.


5.

ART CHANGES NOTHING

Isn’t that what we were taught?
Isn’t that what we inferred 
we should believe?


6.

You sported as a kid 
a woggy mop of hair.

ln time, you’d find a purchase on the world 
in the teachings of Bahaullah. 
Become a subtle painter, 
a provident and gentle patriarch.


7.

As altar boys, we had our separate gigs: 
you did the church, and I did the convent.

Tight-lipped as spies, 
we’d pass one another at the gate, 
our missions shadily divergent.

Shoeman in Love


I fell in love
through a pair of beaded slippers.

She brought them to me
to have the heels repaired.

They were black satin,
the toes hung with jet beads,

and lined with pig-skin,
a leather that absorbs sweat.

Her voice was like pig-skin
fine and strong enough

to absorb me,
but it wasn’t that —

it was the taste
of the imprint of her heel

when I licked it,
holding her slipper

in front of my face
like a cup.

Shower

to S.


That next morning as I stepped from the shower
I caught myself in the mirror, I was shocked 
to see the marks like blackened flowers 
fallen onto snow, fluttering down the backs of my thighs
like finding something huge and succulent and moving.
I looked closer between my thighs 
and on the cheeks of my bottom 
and found the purple blooms.

And right then, the way they say people on the verge of death 
see their lives flash, I saw him behind me
I saw his hands twisted in black fistfuls, my scalp scorched
my throat curved up like an invitation glistening
to a blade and my mouth open wide 
like the death cries of small gods.
I saw him grind me into the bed, the wall
because there was no space no space 
between us, he was pushed so far 
inside me the room had to give.
I saw his hands on my hips smash me into him 
I saw his fingers dig into the flesh
of my ass-cheeks like you would dig 
your way through wet sand 
if you knew something was buried there—
treasure or a living child.

All I wanted was for him to break
me, split me in half 
and then in half again
again and again
until my body was smashed out of existence
like the cliff that becomes
the sand that swims 
inside the sea.

Songs of the fat brown woman
for sista grace (nichols) and the fat black woman


The fat brown woman move in the breeze
under the thatch of the small small fale
braiding sinnet
weaving stories
between the leaves of the pandanus

The fat brown woman sweat in the sun 
lean on a coconut palm 
swaying in the coconut sun 
in colourful lavalava too small for her waist

The fat brown woman in the sea 
is a sight to see 
diving for blue fish red fish 
an occasional eel 
The fat brown woman walking home from the sea 
is a sight to see

Around the fat brown woman there is 
always a man or two 
Big or small 
Smiling smiling 
At the way her hip sway 
At the sound her thigh make 
Around the fat brown woman there is 
always a fly 
or two 
too

See the fat brown woman at a fa’alavelave 
Directing the men the women
A fine mat here
A pig there 
In her fat brown woman voice 
in her fat brown woman style 
gentle but firm 
is the fat brown woman

When the fat brown woman hops on the bus the girls 
and boys whisper 
and men and women whisper 
and children and cat whisper whisper 
and pigs too sometimes 
watch her sway 
sway sway 
and her arms moving like dat 
and a shaking like dat 
is her tummy too

they make room right behind the skinny 
bus driver who gives her a big fat wink 
the fat brown woman takes out a bright red 
hanky wipes the sweat off her brow 
pats her cheek 
adjusts her dress/her bra/
her hip 
chase away the flies 
give the bus driver a mean look 
Is going be a long way to market

So you can look all you want 
And you can watch all you want 
And you can stare all you want 
But the fat brown woman will keep 
swaying her hip 
Keep swaying her hip 
All the way to town



The fat brown woman watches miss universe on tee vee


What do you say is
going through the mind of the fat brown woman
watching miss universe the most beautiful woman in the world?
a aerobic instructa
wants to be a air hostess
a brain surgeon
perhaps
is her dream?
The fat brown woman add more coconut cream to the saka
and adjust her lavalava
call out to her big sista
e! we need to fix dat damn scale!



The fat brown woman’s fat brown sista


Sits in the cool
of an air-conditioned room
directing an organisation
managing an institution
rewriting her constitution



Warning about the fat brown woman


The fat brown woman is quiet as you know
Doesn’t say a word
An occasional laugh
She does not gossip
She does not lie
Will tell you straight away
Whether you sleeping with a fly
but piss the fat brown woman off and you see eyes
you never seen before
and a mouth you
never heard before
And if I was you I’d stay clear out of the way
Of the fat brown woman
When she’s mad
When she’s pissed
I’d stay clear out of the way
If I was you
I’d stay clear out of the way
Of whereva she going sit



A last note on the fat brown woman and shoes


No shoe fits the foot of the fat brown woman
No high heel
No low heel
No prince
No king
Can contain
Constrain
Confine the foot of the fat brown woman
Because the feet of the fat brown woman
Are grounded nicely to the bellies of 
Her Mamas
The fat blue Pacific
The fat brown Earth
Thank you very much
Anna Jackson

SPRING

All day today the ice melted. 
My name is Queen. 
I haven’t melted at all 
though I am soft 
and getting softer 
until I will pardon you all. 
I watch benignly as one by one 
you slink off down diminishing avenues 
to somewhere less central. 
I pardon Jimmy who egged on Joe 
who threw the snowball at Jean 
and I pardon Jean for wiping off the snow 
as if snow were something that should go. 
Even the grass is pushing snow aside. 
I can feel it rising up inside me, too. 
I pardon it 
and get on with my reign.

The boys


It’s a funny old world 
I tell the boys. 
It seems that Bonnie Prince Charlie 
was born in Rome.

‘Och, si,’ they nod, well, 
they’re Aberdeen Angus after all. 
I call them boys 
but strictly speaking they’re steers,

Or castrati you could say, 
though it’s a word 
that they might flinch at. 
And to one who has a raw spot

I say, ‘that is a graze, 
and when you eat the grass, 
that too is grazing.’
They mull this over

As we wander to the boundary fence 
where Henare is finishing up. 
He offers me some 
of his trimmed-off branches.

I look to next year’s firewood, 
the boys make eyes at the foliage. 
‘ Yes, thanks, Henare,’ I say. 
‘ Si, grazie Henare,’ sing the boys. ‘Grazie, ciao.’

The Child in the Gardens: Winter

How sudden, this entering the fallen 
gardens for the first time, to feel the blisters 
of the world’s father, as his own hand 
does. It is everything dying at once, 
the slimed pond and the riffling of leaves, 
shoes drenched across sapless stalks. 
It is what you will read a thousand times. 
You will come to think, who has not stood 
there, holding that large hand, not said 
Can’t we go back – I don’t like this place. 
Your voice sounds like someone else’s. You 
rub a sleeve against your cheek, you want 
him to laugh, to say, ‘The early stars can’t hurt 
us, they are further than trains we hear 
on the clearest of nights.’ We are in a story
called Father, We Must Get Out. 
Leaves scritch at the red walls, 
a stone lady lies near the pond, eating
dirty grass. It is too sudden, this 
walking into time for its first lesson, 
its brown wind, its scummed nasty 
paths. You know how lovely yellow 
is your favourite colour, the kitchen at home.
You touch the big gates as you leave, 
the trees stand on their bones, the shoulders 
on the vandaled statue are huge cold 
eggs. Nothing there wants to move. 
You touch the gates and tell them, We 
are not coming back to this place. Are we, Dad?

THE FLYING FOX AND CHE GUEVARA

I cared for my children like a flying fox 
kept them safe under my wings 
when they were small and hesitant

tipped paracetamol and antibiotics 
down persistently inflamed throats 
during endless nights of earache

gassed them with ventolin cocktails 
when asthma stole their breath

had broken bones reset and a tongue bitten off 
from a faulty landing on a trampoline 
reattached in a theatre without movies

then regretted it 
when that fiapoko mouth 
started up again

we've laughed at dinosaurs and cartoons 
at nana crooning Buffalo Soldier 
at pa's jokes and the bills that kept arriving 
for the ever-declining cashflow card

there were the retreads that outlived cars 
and the unexpected appearance of food 
in our sprayed and wiped-out cupboards

there's so much to think about 
as I sit barefoot in church 
behind the vividly turbaned mamas 
paying their respects to Éloi Machoro

a South Pacific Che Guevara 
a dead son of this island

that siege 
and the photo of Machoro 
smashing a ballot box with an axe

immortalised him beyond the bullets 
that felled a man into a crimson pool

my sons are still learning the difference 
between people's needs and wants 
and how to match actions with words

but I remember

they wore their Che Guevara t-shirts 
until they fell off their backs

The History of Europe


It’s heavy with lupin perfume, the rough 
track. There’s a shine on the claggy clay, 
a double tyre track down the middle.

The pine forest looms like a collapsing 
building. You half expect to see 
two lost children, a slavering wolf,

an old woman gathering sticks in her apron. 
Nothing moves. This is untrue. 
Nothing appears to move but, in fact,

the purpley brown toadstools do 
but imperceptibly, levering their little 
round gun turrets up through the needles.

This is what happens.

Two men step out, silent in the silence, 
one from each side of the dark that wells 
in the dark of the pines. They stand

there braced like a locked gate. 
Each one has a rifle across his chest 
like a sash. It’s the history of Europe.

Soon there will be dogs barking, 
boots crashing through the matagouri. 
Soon there will be shots and the rackety

clatter of a helicopter. Soon there will be 
barked commands, bayonets and baying for blood, 
someone in terror, trying to make a run for it.

THE MONGOLIAN WOMEN'S ORCHESTRA

enter the Mongolian Women's Band 
with 
the years,

 

whose music, theirs and theirs, like language learned, 
inevitable, red and super-sound, 
outplays the days the days that made it mine

 

and beauty beauty adds to it – its stir, 
its wink, its melt, and anything that shines – 
this is The Horse that Overtook the Wind:

 

the little men that ride the plain 
on hearts that will not race again 
whose hoofbeats knock on heaven's door – 
they will not come back anymore

the history of hope is short : 
it has one chapter – Youth. I thought 
that memories would make me wise 
but nothing comes as no surprise

across the windy open spaces 
briefly bright their shining faces 
do with beauty then are gone – 
the horses gallop on and on

 

and if I played my darndest, darndest card, 
who have no beauty now, no more, what tricks 
I take have not the hearts they had before.

 

The Horse that Overtook the Wind is done, 
and beauty beauty raced it well – its stir, 
its wink, its melt and anything that shines.

THE POI GIRLS

Kahu, Mere, and Faith 
stand on the grass 
by the corner. 
They lean 
on the fence and watch you 
walk past – 
spinning, twirling their poi. 
Pou 
Pou 
Pou 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi, 
with each hard slap 
of their poi. 

On your way home 
they're in the same spot, 
Kahu, Mere, and Faith. 
Their older brothers and cousins 
are fixing the car, out 
on Mere's lawn. 
The boys stop as you 
walk by. 
They lean their hands 
on the car's sides and look out 
from under the hood. 
What 
you 
want? 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi. 

You're walking 
down the dip 
but you have left 
your shoes at school. 
The yellow seeds 
stick to your feet, 
and when you get up 
the other side, The Poi Girls 
are looking 
at you. 
Om 
Om 
Om–mee 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi. 
Piss off, 
you tell them, 
leave me alone. 
You don't need 
their crap as well. 

You stuff Pak 'n Save bags 
into white plastic 
and tie 
them up with string. 
You walk past the corner 
twirling and spinning, 
Hey 
you! 
Bumheads! 
you say with your Pak 'n Save poi. 
The Poi Girls chase you 
down the street 
but you are too little and fast 
for them, 
especially for Faith, the fat one, 
the one with the lighter skin. 

One day in the cloakroom 
It's just you and Thomas 
and he tells you 
you have beautiful eyes – 
green and brown, 
just like his girlfriend, Jade's. 
The Poi Girls burst in, twirling. 
You 
kissed 
Thomas! 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi, 
your cheeks 
pounding flush. 

Your sister tells you 
to run through the mud 
and you say you will 
and that you don't even care. 
So you run 
and halfway you sink 
to your waist 
and down the dirt road 
come The Poi Girls, slowing 
to a stop. 
Ha! 
You 
egg 
The Poi Girls 
say with their poi 
and leave 
with your sister 
in tow, twirling. 

It's sunny but cold 
that morning, on the way 
to school. 
Mere's front lawn 
is filled with cars, 
and there are people in suits 
and old koros with sticks 
and The Poi Girls stand 
out the front. 
Mere doesn't 
look at you today, 
so Kahu and Faith 
glare twice as hard for her. 
The Poi Girls' poi 
hang still 
from their hands 
and today 
say nothing at all.Steven Toussaint

THE PROPAGANDA POSTER GIRL

I 
She has emerged from the bamboo forest 
with a white, fleshy-petalled flower

and her gun. 
Save the country,

save the youth 
she is supposed to say

because she is young and solid looking. 
She looks out at her admirers

and critics, distracting them with her stare, 
the clever pattern in her headscarf,

that poorly foreshortened thumb 
and dark pink fist.

She is flat and smooth. 
Foreigners smile at her,

wanting to look good.

II 
Duong Ngoc Canh painted me 
in 1945. Then someone else 
carved my image in wood 
and multiplied me.

I was all over the city, 
flapping against plane trees 
and rolling down the street 
with other rubbish.

Not quite immortal or free from aging 
I was still luckier than most 
for I had hundreds and hundreds 
of lives.

The way you shed eyelashes and skin, 
I let my replicas go painlessly. 
Somewhere in the city, a printing press 
was constantly replacing

what I’d lost.

III 
He admires her elegance, 
that crisp feline stare, 
her constantly changing surveillance

over the tiny gallery’s entrance. 
It’s not his first visit here. 
But still, he admires the elegance

of his situation, the quiet insistence 
of her gun (the same black as her hair). 
Her constantly changing surveillance,

warm then cold; if only he could rinse 
himself in her stare. 
He admires her elegance.

To him, the print’s 
worth more than American dollars just for 
that constantly changing surveillance.

They leave the shop together, an odd pair— 
she tucked under his arm with a look of despair. 
He, admiring the elegance 
of her constantly changing surveillance.

IV 
People like to be looked at, 
especially by beautiful eyes. 
But only up to a point. 
Eventually they 
are no longer open 
to critique, which is why

you should stare secretly. Why 
believe me? I have experience at 
observing. My eyes are always open. 
At times I hate my wide painted eyes, 
though I’m becoming wiser. They, 
I now realise, give my life a point.

That gun slung over my shoulder, the point 
of the barrel behind my headscarf. Why, 
that’s no weapon. My hands are frozen. They 
could never pull a trigger. Now, look at 
the magnolia between my fingers, my eyes 
can’t see it. They only stare out, wide open—

immutably, frustratingly open. An artist carved them with the point 
of his tiny print knife, thinking, ‘Eyes 
as beautiful as a cat’s. Why 
not?’ Carefully prepared, I ended up at 
the gallery, alone with my sight. They,

the art dealer and her daughter, sold me. They 
made twenty US dollars from a man with an open- 
mouthed smile. He seemed to stare at 
everything. Cycling us through Hanoi, he pointed 
out the lake, as if he knew I could see. Why 
he understands me I can’t say. But his eyes

are so glad—pale-lashed, green eyes— 
that I forget to question his awareness. They 
flatter me, sympathise, know why 
it’s hard to be always open 
to malice, accepting it wide-eyed; that’s my point. 
I am obliged to look out at

my viewers, constantly, eyes open 
like a clear conscience. The man realises this point; 
he needs to look at me, and to be looked at.
Peter Olds

THE SHELL

If you hold the shell to your ear you will hear the sounds 
of the sea and the vibrations of the ship as it sails from 
Lyttelton to Wellington ‘overnight’ across Cook Strait— 
or so my grandmother told me …

Hold the shell to your ear, hear the sounds of the sea: 
the sandhill’s grasses whistling over sliding sand where a boy 
leaves his sandals. Stand at the lace curtains on tip-toe and watch 
the ship’s long, low lights gleam through North Beach’s mist

on its way to Wellington. The surf booming from a sea-shell 
like a bakelite radio tuned to Aunt Daisy. 
The maiden-hair fern on the table; the black polished stove 
with its row of vents glowing like ship’s lights.

And after you’ve seen and heard it all, it’s time for bed … 
The shell is put back on the shelf next to the clock and pencils 
and the envelopes for writing letters to people in faraway places: 
people who eat porridge without burning their lips.

THE STARLINGS

Anger sang in that house until the scrim walls thrummed. 
The clamour rang the window panes, dizzying up chimneys. 
Get on, get on, the wide rooms cried, until it seemed our unease 
as we passed on the stairs or chewed our meals in dimmed

light were all an attending to that voice. And so we got on, 
and to muffle that sound we gibbed and plastered, built 
shelves for all our good books. What we sometimes felt 
is hard to say. We replaced what we thought was rotten.

I remember the starlings, the pair that returned to that gap 
above the purple hydrangeas, between weatherboard and eaves. 
The same birds, we thought, not knowing how long a starling lives. 
For twenty years they came and went, flit and pause and up

into that hidden place. A dry rustle at night, fidgeting, calling, 
a murmuration: bird business. The vastness and splendour 
of their piecemeal activity, their lives' long labour, 
we discovered at last; blinking, in the murk of the ceiling,

at that whole cavernous space filled, stuffed like a haybarn. 
It was like gold, except it was more like shit and straw, 
jumbled with their own young, dead, desiccated, sinew 
and bone, fledgling and newborn. Starlings only learn

a little thing, made big from not knowing when to leave off: 
gone past all need except need, enough never enough.

The Strong Mothers

Where are the mothers who held power 
and children, preserved peaches 
in season, understood about 
greens and two classes of protein 
who drove cars or did not have a licence 
who laughed, raged and were there? 
Take Mrs Russell who rode her irate bike, 
an upright fly that buzzed 
with a small engine on its back wheel 
up South Road past the school football field 
on her way to the hospital. Consider 
the other Mrs Russell, drama judge, teacher of 
speech and elocution in a small front room, 
part-time reporter on The Hawera Star. 
And Mrs Ellingham who had an MA in French, 
ah, the university. Or Mrs Smith, one knee stiff 
with TB, her tennis parties on Saturdays, adults 
on banks and we smoked their cigarettes in the bamboo. 
Her legs shone, their skin in diamonds like a lizard’s. 
Then Mrs Chapman who sang in the church choir, 
formed brooches from fresh white bread, 
made you look for a needle till you found it, 
heated records and shaped them into vases for presents 
who did a spring display in the window of Gamages Hats.

They have left the vowels uncorrected, the stories unproofed. 
They have rested their bicycles inside their garages, 
looked up the last word, la dernière mot, in Harraps Dictionary,
let needles lie in the narrow dust between verandah boards. 
They have tested the last jam on a saucer by a window 
comforted the last crying child they will ever see, 
and left. How we miss them and their great strength. 
Wait for us, we say, wait for me. 
And they will.
Andrew Johnston

THE SUNFLOWER 

for Stuart Johnston, 1931–2004

One young bloom in a vase or jar, breath- 
takingly yellow. And her 
hands, in the morning light, the way 
they arrange and rearrange. Death 
brings lilies, but someone has sent a sunflower: 
this is our penance, staring at the sun, 
its blind eye, its ragged halo. The day, 
in the end, took to its bed 
before the day was over, taking thee 
with it. Soon this flower, too, will be dead, 
its summer of wondering done 
about the sun, petal by petal: loved me;

didn’t know how; did, unsayably so. It leaves me 
as he left us, in the dark. From one breath 
to the next, he’d deflect a question: in his the- 
ology, I, me, mine were just not done. 
Because he saw eye to eye with death 
we can stare at the sunflower all day 
but his heavenly father’s garden was further 
than we were prepared to go—its bed 
of blood-red roses, its promises, its premises, the way 
everything had been arranged; ‘dead’ 
a manner of speaking, under the sun. 
We counted ourselves lucky, hour by hour,

and by the minutes of the sunflower 
(he doesn’t, he does, he doesn’t know me), 
each in his or her own way worshipping the sun 
and coming to other arrangements with death— 
that it is the end, in the abstract. And then one day 
someone calls, and you take a deep, deep breath. 
Sister nor’wester, southerly brother— 
into the mind of the man we guess our way, 
blind and deaf, senseless, because he is dead. 
From the end of the earth I will cry unto thee, 
as daughters and sons have always done, 
for words unsaid. The riverbed

was dry and I was thirsty. By your bed, 
near the end, we could count our 
blessings: each day, 
for one thing, and though it was winter, the sun. 
A sisterly sixth sense, when death 
began to bloom, flew me 
from the end of the earth. In a week you were dead 
but we shadowed one another 
through the brittle days before you went away. 
You talked and talked, as you’d always done, 
of all but you, till you were out of breath. 
I would have liked to hear—despite your fear of the-

atre (so foolish was I, and ignorant, before thee)— 
about your mother, for instance, who took to bed 
when tempers rose; and how the sun 
had burned a dead- 
ly thirst into your father’s breath; 
but the hard facts I craved, my mother 
knew, were the same stones, day 
after day, that you buried in death- 
ly silence, so that in this inscrutable way 
you could build—for you, for her, for six including me— 
a house, a plain, safe house, with a sunflower 
in the garden. ‘That which is done

is that which shall be done’ 
is all very well in the- 
ory, but what if the sun 
were black, and the book dead 
wrong, and the interval under death 
demanded a father 
as unlike his father as day 
and night? A breath 
of wind reaches me 
from the rose-bed; 
in its vase or jar the sunflower 
nods politely. Halfway

across the Channel, halfway 
between waking and sleeping, my mind undone, 
I had, as luck would have it, something of an inkling. The day 
had been long; as I lay in the boat’s narrow bed 
a wave of black joy lifted me and left in me 
knowledge so dark it shone. I held my breath. 
Fear fell away, of death, and other 
fears; the end, in the end, was the darkest jewel. I was dead 
tired, and fatigue’s mysterious flower 
spoke perhaps in tongues. But that black sun 
still shines—a talisman, obsidian, a bright antithe- 
sis. Its darkness made light of death

at most, however, for me; the death 
of someone else is something else. Your way 
led over the border; I am a stranger with thee, 
and a sojourner, but wherever I am, my place in the sun 
you prepared. His earthly power 
spent, your god, to us, is dead, 
but it was your belief that gave us breath, 
the life we take for granted every day. 
What sense of your sense will I take with me? 
How much of your world will we hand on? 
Just before the end, on the wall beside your bed, 
Peter pinned Leonardo’s St. Anne. Her

smile, wry, reminds me of you, and her 
hand-on-hip benevolence. Wherever death 
leads, we can meet here. The power 
of light in van Eyck and Vermeer. The breath 
of Wallace Stevens, overhearing his way 
to work. Every Henry James you read in bed, 
destiny and destiny like night and day. 
The valedictory music of ‘The Dead’. 
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee 
but when all—or almost all—is said and done 
sometimes it seemed you believed no less than me 
that when we die we go into the sun.

There is nothing new under the sun 
but much of it is mystery: this my mother knows. Her 
psychological eye revised your the- 
ological line. They’d converge, anyway, 
at the library—your rain-cloud, your seed-bed. 
You read and read and read. And saved your breath 
not to write yourself, but to make each day 
bloom and turn. The astonishing flower, 
head full of edible seeds, bows down dead: 
this is the credible sense of its death, 
that here, where its turning is done 
other journeys begin. It seems to me 

you believed what you believed, but it strikes me, 
too, that the seeds you sowed, in the mind’s sun, 
mattered most. (Sometimes they grew a bed 
of nails: you were often ‘sick to death’ 
of fads and feuds, the way 
they shut out the sun.) Flower 
of wonder, flower of might: if I see thee 
on the other side, when I am dead, 
I’ll know there is an other 
side. Till then, while we have breath, 
our burgeoning work is not done: 
what we have been given is a rich, difficult day

that could go on without us, nevertheless, all day, 
whistling a cryptic tune. It comes to me 
in the conservatory, where we catch a little sun: 
I didn’t know you well, and then you went away 
but in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee 
because you were a man to get things done. 
In its vase or jar, the young sunflower 
I imagine has served its purpose. Beneath its bed, 
all along, the river was flowing—deep, where death 
knows more than we. Sylvia dons her 
gardening gloves to gather the dead 
roses. Man cannot utter it, but under his breath:

‘Remember me, my loves, when I am dead.’ 
Rest on memory’s sea-bed: we will swim down to thee. 
And in our own blue day, we will gaze at death 
the way this one young bloom would gaze at the sun. 
In the garden of the living, my mother stops for breath. 
Thou thy worldly task hast done. And seeds rain from the sunflower.

THE THREEPENNY KOWHAI STAMP BROOCH

If I get lost someone will pick me up and post me. 
I am already licked and stamped on my green lapel.

The brooch from Te Papa will see me safely home. 
It's 3D – as in LSD – pounds, shillings and pence.

Let us go out and do the passegiata on the waterfront. 
If and when I get lost, you can slide me into the red box.

Of course I will be posted back into the past – 
back to when kowhai was pronounced kowhai.Joan Fleming

THEORY OF LIGHT

Andy goes craving all over the beach 
with her red grip and her red grapple.

A red apple after dark isn’t red, 
it’s a black apple.

She says she’ll black up if she doesn’t have salt. 
She finds a sea urchin full of holes.

What’s a blue sea after dark? 
Are these the spaces where breath goes?

I find a gorgeous gold-yellow branch, 
a colour, a describable friend.

We carry our findings, our branches 
and urchins, from end to end.

The blue and red and yellow everywhere 
is our theory of colour, of light.

Young salt-footed fools, you know there are no ends, 
only ends in sight.

To a woman who fainted recently at a poetry reading

A blood pressure of ninety millimetres of mercury is normally required to adequately perfuse the central nervous system. If the head is lowered, however, the pressure needed to maintain consciousness is considerably lower. Of course if one has severed a major artery or torn it lengthwise like a weak seam in the lining of a jacket then poetry should not be blamed and, in fact, may become entirely appropriate.

It is wise to consider hypoglycaemia as a contributing factor. I have heard that a barley sugar placed per rectum in obtunded patients with a precipitously low serum glucose may at times mean the difference between them dying and never eating barley sugar again.

Simple dehydration, overheating or a sudden shock can also be associated with fainting. For this last reason poetry should not be left lying around especially if it is graphic in nature, with swear words in it like ‘bugger’ or ‘bastard’ or ‘shit’. Lines such as ‘She used to love me but now I am a crumb in the biscuit tin of life’ can induce vomiting. ‘She used to love me / My heart is the sound of oysters opening at low tide’ can also be counted on to take the breath away.

Micturation syncope is a syndrome in which men who increase their intra-abdominal pressure at the moment of urination can impair their venous return, cardiac output and subsequently faint, however this cause will usually be obvious from the history and immediate setting. Individuals suffering in this manner can sometimes be confused with those who have drunk too much then pissed themselves before collapsing.

Despite a strong link between alcohol and poetry this scenario seems unlikely to be the case in your situation and so it only remains for me to write you the following prescription – four black wheels swallowed whole like pills; one siren, the blade of a sharp knife; three sheets, as crisp as biting apples, two flashing lights striking matches in the wind – and in this small ambulance send you, like flowers, straight to hospital.

To Death

Death takes them all, that’s why
We never see it. Death’s never in
The picture. But everything we see, we see
Because death has. Death took the pictures.
Death looked at Chloe whom the poet

Begged not to run to her mother. Chloe 
Ran into the oblivious arms of death.
Quintilius lies in the sleep that goes on
Without ever ending, and the music has faded away
That could have restored blood to the veins of the shade

Death saw. Lydia no longer
Wakes up to hear the sound of gravel thrown
Against her shuttered windows in the night.
Death pictured what lay behind the shutters
And Lydia grew old on the journey between

Her chamber and the dark street where death waited.
O passerby, do not refuse a few
Handfuls of sand to cover up the corpse
Of Archytas. It may be you who needs these rites
Some day, when death has viewed you as he did Archytas,

Who counted all the uncountable grains of sand
On the lonely beach. Death pictured my mother
And my father on the Picton foreshore, cheek by cheek
Under Gemini, twin sons unborn, tinkle 
Of jazz from the ferryboat. And death looked at their sons.

TWO SECURITY GUARDS TALKING ABOUT JUPITER

Four little canvas bags of takings, one float, one 
cash box and two guards to open the security room 
where the squat safe is waiting. End of day ritual

but tonight they are talking of Jupiter 
in male fashion. Did you see that 
TV programme? About what the Earth

will be like when it dries out? A prune 
sinking in on itself, a dust bowl falling 
inwards like the orchestrated blowing up

of a building that comes down on the 
spot ordained. Jupiter, on the contrary, 
is a crystal planet. How strange, fitting

the cash bags in, pushing the cash box back 
turning the handle so the teeth of the door mesh 
and the maker’s gold seal glows in the light

then finally the long thin key that someone 
locked in the room might turn to open 
to take out the bags and play with the money

but be unable to escape because the door 
is deadbolted. Walking away, thinking 
how like a little safe this planet is

locked tight, we trust, for the night 
its systems meshed. Earth preserved in its 
abundant waters, Jupiter in its dark moonlets.
James Brown

UNIVERSITY OPEN DAY

English was the uncoolest: awkward people 
reading Shakespeare in a room. 
We got trapped, but managed to get out 
before the poetry started.

Food Tech was okay, with fresh bread 
dyed to look mouldy, and bright blue juice 
that it was easy to guess was lemon. 
You could buy cans of air, too.

There was a long queue at Chemistry 
because you got to make potions. 
One of the white-coats 
came rushing out in a real lather.

Psychology had us reading 
a short paragraph describing ‘Mr Smith’, 
then answering questions about his 
personality. Opinions divided neatly.

The trick turned out to be a single word. 
Some paragraphs described Mr Smith 
as ‘warm’, others as ‘cold’. 
The psychologists beamed cleverly.

‘Applied commonsense,’ snorted a man 
wearing a Microbiologists 
               are Little Buggers T-shirt. 
Outside, padded eggs were being dropped

from a rooftop. Engineering. 
People kept saying Vet was best. 
It had the cow with the glass panel. 
Actually, the panel wasn’t that interesting,

sort of dark and red. The cow 
was eating hay in a small concrete room. 
Mostly it just ate, but now and then 
it would look sadly round at everyone,

and that’s when I got to thinking 
about philosophy. 
The department wasn’t easy to find. 
It turned out to be a single office

down a badly lit corridor. 
A faded note on the door said 
‘Back in 10’. And so 
my education began.

Waitakere Rain


Ernest Hemingway found rain to be
made of knowledge, experience
wine oil salt vinegar quince
bed early mornings nights days the sea
men women dogs hill and rich valley
the appearance and disappearance of sense
or trains on curved and straight tracks, hence
love honour and dishonour, a scent of infinity.
In my city the rain you get
is made of massive kauri trees, the call of forest birds
howling dark oceans and mangroved creeks.
I taste constancy, memory and yet
there’s the watery departure of words
from the thunder-black sand at Te Henga Beach.
Gordon Challis

 
  



Walking an imaginary dog


You have to do this where I live —
the caravan park does not allow real ones.
Every morning
I slip out before too many people are around
dragging the dog at first
finding any spare power points
available to charge him up;
those with caravans already there
he pisses on
discharging an electrolytic urine
which strips the paint.
Then we try
outside the park: the sandflats of the creek,
the oyster-bladed rocks, the mangroves’
many attempts to start out again for heaven.

He sniffs heaven
in onion smells before the steak goes on
and makes no judgement whether breakfast
is the right time.

I go behind him holding the leash
gently though not letting him
surge too far foraging ahead
not too far down my road.
To passers-by I would appear
a blind man trusting my hand
to scan for obstacles or
reaching out to touch the small face of a child.

Where I Went


I auditioned for the part. And this way 
I came to dance 
to a confusion of heartbeat monitors and

portable radios. And so it fell upon me 
to be the singing one 
in a room given too much to silence.

In the intermittent light I was 
speckled and 
free. At the far end of each jaded afternoon

I was a six-foot dispenser of 
effervescent drinks. 
The ward was in need of a popular song

and I was it – a sponge to remove 
unnecessary detail 
from the ceiling so no one

was reminded of a world before 
this one. I was 
the overflowing one in the parched room.

And beside the far bed I was a student 
of an Austrian architect 
a pair of sunglasses grazing the night sky.

For him I wrote ‘Vienna’ across Evans Bay. 
But in the morning 
he told me, it was the designs of Maori buildings

I wore upon my chin. I was light-footed 
in the crippled room 
where the floor stared up at me

an ensemble of coloured things, my words
a cloth to soak them up 
or remove them. Later I emptied

all the instruments of their music 
like fruit, then I emptied 
any other thing that might contain

music. I stayed all night in the day room 
and the night stayed 
with me. I was its furniture, its sweeping broom,

ninety per cent song and ten per cent flesh 
of its body. I was paid 
to weep in the laughing room and laugh

in the room of diminished hope. I was 
the ripe one 
in the spoiled room, where it fell upon me to dispense

glasses of water and ceilinged sky to the 
recently awakened 
and to those who awaken each day

with a fresh skyscape sewn across the surface 
of their heads. These men 
and women who could see through me.

I brought them the brightest drinks, the most 
iridescent straws 
and the coloured shadows that fell upon

their throats as they drank were both the last 
shadows of a fiery world 
gone out and a reflection of

the next to come. When I left the dying room 
I was the shape of everything 
into which I had been poured.

And the room behind me was empty 
and I was filled 
to overflowing with it, where I went.

White Saris

for my son
What I knew of their house 
was a blue garage door,
kicked-in at the middle.
A buckling dent.

You approach a scene like that
with caution. It takes time
to know whether to pause
or hurry, head down.

Their glowing white saris 
on this grey marble day. 
Outside the buckled
door, a station wagon, black.

I was thinking of you. How you 
will find out. The black suit
you will wear. How the feel
of your best white shirt could hurt.

How silk might hang 
in a cold wardrobe. I pushed
you through those people. 
I pushed you along the road.

Without

Crossing Cook Strait
going home to be
ordained in the

parish of his 
father, while seas wished
by and the wind

had its say in the
wires, it came to
him there was no

God. Not that
God was sulking or had
turned His back—that

had happened 
often. It was that God
wasn’t there, was

nowhere, a Word
without reference or
object. Who was

God? He was the
Lord. What Lord was
that? The Lord God. Back

and forth it went while
stern lifted, screw
shuddered, stars glowed

and faded. The
universe was losing
weight. It was

then he threw his
Bible into the
sea. He was a

poet and would
write his own. Happiness
was nothing

but not being
sad. It was your
self in this one and

only moment 
without grief or
remorse, without God

or a future—sea, 
sky, the decks 
rolling underfoot.
Lynn Jenner

WOMENS BUSINESS

When I had a son in his early teens 
a Russian thought formed in my head 
that if a war came I would cut off 
the index finger of his right hand 
so that he would be no use for fighting. 
The part of me which visits 
hospitals would do the cutting. 
I wouldn’t care if he hated me 
for what I did. 
I might even be pleased. 
By this time I knew that he was nearly 
a man, and that if I didn’t cut his finger off 
or shoot him in the foot, he would go. 
Even if he was afraid. 
Even if he thought it was pointless. 
Now he is a man and I ask him 
to carry my suitcase.

X-Ray


It’s difficult not to be curious
about this bone-man under the skin:
to think how he’s carried me over the years
without malice or contempt. In return
I’ve fed and clothed him of course,
shared the same bed, been shaped by his will,
but even after a lifetime together
I can’t say I know him, not for real . . .
apart, that is, from a broken wrist
when he once came peeping through.
And now there’s this inner-map of his ills,
that ageing stoop, those honeycombed hips,
the thinning tail-end bits. But what
really appals is his Model-T look.
He’s indistinguishable — except to the nurse —
From the millions like him who’ve come and gone
since one of us first stood up. Perhaps
it’s time to applaud his ancestral support
and keep this negative by the bed. Even then
it’ll be tough to view that crumbling master-plan
without a more personal sense of loss.
James Norcliffe

YET ANOTHER POEM ABOUT A GIRAFFE

pity the poor giraffe 
lost on the frozen steppe

his wishbone legs 
make pipe-holes in the snow

the stunted furze 
laughs at his reaching neck

for Africa is 
sixty degrees below

the hoarfrost catches 
in his soulful lashes

his brown eyes lost 
beneath the arctic moon

his blotched hide a map 
of hopeless wishes

the swishing tail 
a pendulum of doom

so he stands withstands 
the bitter polar blast

that rips the fluttering 
pages of his dreams

the flickering pixels 
of a brilliant past

when the world was warm 
and still and green
