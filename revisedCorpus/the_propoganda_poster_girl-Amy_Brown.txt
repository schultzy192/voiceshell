Amy Brown

THE PROPAGANDA POSTER GIRL

I 
She has emerged from the bamboo forest 
with a white, fleshy-petalled flower

and her gun. 
Save the country,

save the youth 
she is supposed to say

because she is young and solid looking. 
She looks out at her admirers

and critics, distracting them with her stare, 
the clever pattern in her headscarf,

that poorly foreshortened thumb 
and dark pink fist.

She is flat and smooth. 
Foreigners smile at her,

wanting to look good.

II 
Duong Ngoc Canh painted me 
in 1945. Then someone else 
carved my image in wood 
and multiplied me.

I was all over the city, 
flapping against plane trees 
and rolling down the street 
with other rubbish.

Not quite immortal or free from aging 
I was still luckier than most 
for I had hundreds and hundreds 
of lives.

The way you shed eyelashes and skin, 
I let my replicas go painlessly. 
Somewhere in the city, a printing press 
was constantly replacing

what I’d lost.

III 
He admires her elegance, 
that crisp feline stare, 
her constantly changing surveillance

over the tiny gallery’s entrance. 
It’s not his first visit here. 
But still, he admires the elegance

of his situation, the quiet insistence 
of her gun (the same black as her hair). 
Her constantly changing surveillance,

warm then cold; if only he could rinse 
himself in her stare. 
He admires her elegance.

To him, the print’s 
worth more than American dollars just for 
that constantly changing surveillance.

They leave the shop together, an odd pair— 
she tucked under his arm with a look of despair. 
He, admiring the elegance 
of her constantly changing surveillance.

IV 
People like to be looked at, 
especially by beautiful eyes. 
But only up to a point. 
Eventually they 
are no longer open 
to critique, which is why

you should stare secretly. Why 
believe me? I have experience at 
observing. My eyes are always open. 
At times I hate my wide painted eyes, 
though I’m becoming wiser. They, 
I now realise, give my life a point.

That gun slung over my shoulder, the point 
of the barrel behind my headscarf. Why, 
that’s no weapon. My hands are frozen. They 
could never pull a trigger. Now, look at 
the magnolia between my fingers, my eyes 
can’t see it. They only stare out, wide open—

immutably, frustratingly open. An artist carved them with the point 
of his tiny print knife, thinking, ‘Eyes 
as beautiful as a cat’s. Why 
not?’ Carefully prepared, I ended up at 
the gallery, alone with my sight. They,

the art dealer and her daughter, sold me. They 
made twenty US dollars from a man with an open- 
mouthed smile. He seemed to stare at 
everything. Cycling us through Hanoi, he pointed 
out the lake, as if he knew I could see. Why 
he understands me I can’t say. But his eyes

are so glad—pale-lashed, green eyes— 
that I forget to question his awareness. They 
flatter me, sympathise, know why 
it’s hard to be always open 
to malice, accepting it wide-eyed; that’s my point. 
I am obliged to look out at

my viewers, constantly, eyes open 
like a clear conscience. The man realises this point; 
he needs to look at me, and to be looked at.
