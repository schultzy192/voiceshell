Where I Went


I auditioned for the part. And this way 
I came to dance 
to a confusion of heartbeat monitors and

portable radios. And so it fell upon me 
to be the singing one 
in a room given too much to silence.

In the intermittent light I was 
speckled and 
free. At the far end of each jaded afternoon

I was a six-foot dispenser of 
effervescent drinks. 
The ward was in need of a popular song

and I was it – a sponge to remove 
unnecessary detail 
from the ceiling so no one

was reminded of a world before 
this one. I was 
the overflowing one in the parched room.

And beside the far bed I was a student 
of an Austrian architect 
a pair of sunglasses grazing the night sky.

For him I wrote ‘Vienna’ across Evans Bay. 
But in the morning 
he told me, it was the designs of Maori buildings

I wore upon my chin. I was light-footed 
in the crippled room 
where the floor stared up at me

an ensemble of coloured things, my words
a cloth to soak them up 
or remove them. Later I emptied

all the instruments of their music 
like fruit, then I emptied 
any other thing that might contain

music. I stayed all night in the day room 
and the night stayed 
with me. I was its furniture, its sweeping broom,

ninety per cent song and ten per cent flesh 
of its body. I was paid 
to weep in the laughing room and laugh

in the room of diminished hope. I was 
the ripe one 
in the spoiled room, where it fell upon me to dispense

glasses of water and ceilinged sky to the 
recently awakened 
and to those who awaken each day

with a fresh skyscape sewn across the surface 
of their heads. These men 
and women who could see through me.

I brought them the brightest drinks, the most 
iridescent straws 
and the coloured shadows that fell upon

their throats as they drank were both the last 
shadows of a fiery world 
gone out and a reflection of

the next to come. When I left the dying room 
I was the shape of everything 
into which I had been poured.

And the room behind me was empty 
and I was filled 
to overflowing with it, where I went.
