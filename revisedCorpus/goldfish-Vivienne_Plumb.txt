Goldfish


My son doesn’t go to school 
any more he goes somewhere
else. He goes out walking alone
with his hat on his head, 
lies on a bed, where they slip 
a drip to the vein and
he has his body pumped full. 
Funny how they grow up 
says the woman who is the chemist, 
Is it your only one? 
It’s harder then because you’ve spoilt them 
here’s your prescription, forty nine dollars. 
I try to pretend 
she doesn’t know a thing, a thing that she’s saying. 
Here’s a red light outside 
and I have to stop, and everywhere there’s children 
a reminder of the way we come 
into the world, birth, growth, 
and end up fat or thin. 
He, my own, was thin before 
the drugs set in and made him fat, 
now he looks like a frog. 
There’s a dog on the way home 
so I pat it, sign of the hope 
I have for the future. 
When I get in he’s on the bed 
I can tell he feels bad, don’t
he says. He often says that. 
Or come here and he holds my 
hand and there we are, two 
tiny pebbles perched on the edge, 
with the silvery sand far below us. 
We don’t like to use the C-word 
says one white coat. 
They prefer the ambiguous 
nodes to tumours, or even 
bumps and lumps, if you were dumb 
you might think you had mumps. 
ln ward one he starts to tell me 
his dream: we are chased 
by a giant goldfish, we reach 
a cellar, we are trapped 
by the goggle-eyed fish in a dead 
sea end, and then suddenly 
he is all alone with an enormous 
tome on his lap, the words medical 
dictionary are embossed on its cover, 
and he opens it, and he begins to read.
