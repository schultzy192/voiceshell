LINES FOR A NEW YEAR

I like the branch 
I find myself on

a view over the garden 
all the way down to the beach

the family below me 
gathered in the garden

debating where I’ve gone. 
My father’s got a theory.

I like the branch 
I find myself on.

*

You know how it is

to give up the piss 
a week to the

day before Christmas

you know how it is

to fall over sober 
safe in some spot,

come to later 
remembering the lot.

*

the rugby ball kicked 
far as the far paddock

where an apple tree caught it. 
Was agreed among folk

they’d never seen such a catch, 
such a kick, such a match.

*

I gave it away lately 
I had no choice, 
no need pump the brakes— 
they’d already seized.

I like your poison, lady, 
I like it too much: 
which is why I am 
          where I am today 
outside of thought, beyond your touch.

I said I’ll be seeing you. 
You knew what I meant, 
at least you seemed to. 
Was the message you got 
the same one I sent?

*

It’s a love song 
between a mother and son.

The son plays the drums 
and wrote the song.

On the recording 
mother sings the song

like mothers do. And the 
son plays the drums

like a good boy. It′s a 
love song.

*

A friend used to say 
my dog and I 
had the same way of walking,

especially walking away. 
Which was 
often the case.

These days there’s 
not much happening. 
It’s people walking toward me

asking, where’s the dog, 
the dog? And they’re 
right. Where is he?

*

You live in this world 
you have no choice. 
Silence would be fine. 
But you give it voice—

you have to, you cannot 
help yourself. 
Your mother says you never knew 
when enough was enough.

*

Dreamt I met Thomas Hardy 
walking a local back road. 
He was an old man 
but coped okay with his cane.

He said he was looking for 
a woman called Lizbie Brown. 
I said I knew her name— 
but only from his poem.

*

Sitting on a clifftop 
was always a dream 
that more or less came true. 
Just the words dried up.

*

Friends disappear 
off the face of the earth. 
For what it’s worth 
I loved you. 
But you can’t hear.

*

Is said (what few 
elders we have left) 
anyone for whom birds sing 
all night through to dawn

are themselves 
close to eternal bird-song: 
their time, among these branches, 
that of the elders—not long.

*

If this were the view 
I got all year through— 
a branch of a tree at the window—

I would become that 
branch of tree and with it 
grow.

The nurses agree 
I never complain 
about the rain, or pain.

Easy, when you know 
you’re a tree 
at the window.

*

When I poured her a cup of tea 
and asked her, strong or weak? 
she held out a dark wrist: 
same colour as this.

*

I’m off to look at angels. 
And toetoe if I see it.

The family move in close. 
No way out but

close my eyes to see

if anything’s left of the toetoe, 
and the angels.
