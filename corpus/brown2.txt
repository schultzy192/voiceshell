James Brown
UNIVERSITY OPEN DAY

English was the uncoolest: awkward people 
reading Shakespeare in a room. 
We got trapped, but managed to get out 
before the poetry started.

Food Tech was okay, with fresh bread 
dyed to look mouldy, and bright blue juice 
that it was easy to guess was lemon. 
You could buy cans of air, too.

There was a long queue at Chemistry 
because you got to make potions. 
One of the white-coats 
came rushing out in a real lather.

Psychology had us reading 
a short paragraph describing ‘Mr Smith’, 
then answering questions about his 
personality. Opinions divided neatly.

The trick turned out to be a single word. 
Some paragraphs described Mr Smith 
as ‘warm’, others as ‘cold’. 
The psychologists beamed cleverly.

‘Applied commonsense,’ snorted a man 
wearing a Microbiologists 
               are Little Buggers T-shirt. 
Outside, padded eggs were being dropped

from a rooftop. Engineering. 
People kept saying Vet was best. 
It had the cow with the glass panel. 
Actually, the panel wasn’t that interesting,

sort of dark and red. The cow 
was eating hay in a small concrete room. 
Mostly it just ate, but now and then 
it would look sadly round at everyone,

and that’s when I got to thinking 
about philosophy. 
The department wasn’t easy to find. 
It turned out to be a single office

down a badly lit corridor. 
A faded note on the door said 
‘Back in 10’. And so 
my education began.
