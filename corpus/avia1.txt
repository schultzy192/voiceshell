Tusiata Avia
Shower

to S.


That next morning as I stepped from the shower
I caught myself in the mirror, I was shocked 
to see the marks like blackened flowers 
fallen onto snow, fluttering down the backs of my thighs
like finding something huge and succulent and moving.
I looked closer between my thighs 
and on the cheeks of my bottom 
and found the purple blooms.

And right then, the way they say people on the verge of death 
see their lives flash, I saw him behind me
I saw his hands twisted in black fistfuls, my scalp scorched
my throat curved up like an invitation glistening
to a blade and my mouth open wide 
like the death cries of small gods.
I saw him grind me into the bed, the wall
because there was no space no space 
between us, he was pushed so far 
inside me the room had to give.
I saw his hands on my hips smash me into him 
I saw his fingers dig into the flesh
of my ass-cheeks like you would dig 
your way through wet sand 
if you knew something was buried there—
treasure or a living child.

All I wanted was for him to break
me, split me in half 
and then in half again
again and again
until my body was smashed out of existence
like the cliff that becomes
the sand that swims 
inside the sea.
