THE THREEPENNY KOWHAI STAMP BROOCH

If I get lost someone will pick me up and post me. 
I am already licked and stamped on my green lapel.

The brooch from Te Papa will see me safely home. 
It's 3D – as in LSD – pounds, shillings and pence.

Let us go out and do the passegiata on the waterfront. 
If and when I get lost, you can slide me into the red box.

Of course I will be posted back into the past – 
back to when kowhai was pronounced kowhai.
